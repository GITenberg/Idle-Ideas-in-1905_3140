<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>ARE WE
AS INTERESTING AS WE THINK WE ARE?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Charmed</span>.&nbsp; Very hot
weather we&rsquo;ve been having of late&mdash;I mean cold.&nbsp;
Let me see, I did not quite catch your name just now.&nbsp; Thank
you so much.&nbsp; Yes, it is a bit close.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a
silence falls, neither of us being able to think what next to
say.</p>
<p>What has happened is this: My host has met me in the doorway,
and shaken me heartily by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad you were able to come,&rdquo; he has
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some friends of mine here, very anxious to
meet you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has bustled me across the room.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Delightful people.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll like them&mdash;have
read all your books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has brought me up to a stately lady, and has presented
me.&nbsp; We have exchanged the customary commonplaces, and she,
I feel, is waiting for me to say something clever, original and
tactful.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know whether she is Presbyterian
or Mormon; a Protectionist or a Free Trader; whether she is
engaged to be married or has lately been divorced!</p>
<p>A friend of mine adopts the sensible plan of always providing
you with a short history of the person to whom he is about to
lead you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to introduce you to a Mrs. Jones,&rdquo; he
whispers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clever woman.&nbsp; Wrote a book two years
ago.&nbsp; Forget the name of it.&nbsp; Something about
twins.&nbsp; Keep away from sausages.&nbsp; Father ran a pork
shop in the Borough.&nbsp; Husband on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;
Keep off coke.&nbsp; Unpleasantness about a company.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll get on best by sticking to the book.&nbsp; Lot in it
about platonic friendship.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t seem to be looking
too closely at her.&nbsp; Has a slight squint she tries to
hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we have reached the lady, and he introduces me as
a friend of his who is simply dying to know her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wants to talk about your book,&rdquo; he
explains.&nbsp; &ldquo;Disagrees with you entirely on the subject
of platonic friendship.&nbsp; Sure you&rsquo;ll be able to
convince him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It saves us both a deal of trouble.&nbsp; I start at once on
platonic friendship, and ask her questions about twins, avoiding
sausages and coke.&nbsp; She thinks me an unusually interesting
man, and I am less bored than otherwise I might be.</p>
<p>I have sometimes thought it would be a serviceable device if,
in Society, we all of us wore a neat card&mdash;pinned, say, upon
our back&mdash;setting forth such information as was necessary;
our name legibly written, and how to be pronounced; our age (not
necessarily in good faith, but for purposes of
conversation.&nbsp; Once I seriously hurt a German lady by
demanding of her information about the Franco-German war.&nbsp;
She looked to me as if she could not object to being taken for
forty.&nbsp; It turned out she was thirty-seven.&nbsp; Had I not
been an Englishman I might have had to fight a duel); our
religious and political beliefs; together with a list of the
subjects we were most at home upon; and a few facts concerning
our career&mdash;sufficient to save the stranger from, what is
vulgarly termed &ldquo;putting his foot in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Before making jokes about &ldquo;Dumping,&rdquo; or discussing
the question of Chinese Cheap Labour, one would glance behind and
note whether one&rsquo;s companion was ticketed
&ldquo;Whole-hogger,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pro-Boer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Guests desirous of agreeable partners&mdash;an &ldquo;agreeable
person,&rdquo; according to the late Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
definition, being &ldquo;a person who agrees with
you&rdquo;&mdash;could make their own selection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&nbsp; Would you mind turning round a
minute?&nbsp; Ah, &lsquo;Wagnerian Crank!&rsquo;&nbsp; I am
afraid we should not get on together. I prefer the Italian
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, &ldquo;How delightful.&nbsp; I see you don&rsquo;t believe
in vaccination.&nbsp; May I take you into supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those, on the other hand, fond of argument would choose a
suitable opponent.&nbsp; A master of ceremonies might be provided
who would stand in the centre of the room and call for partners:
&ldquo;Lady with strong views in favour of female franchise
wishes to meet gentleman holding the opinions of St. Paul.&nbsp;
With view to argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An American lady, a year or two ago, wrote me a letter that
did me real good: she appreciated my work with so much
understanding, criticised it with such sympathetic
interest.&nbsp; She added that, when in England the summer
before, she had been on the point of accepting an invitation to
meet me; but at the last moment she had changed her mind; she
felt so sure&mdash;she put it pleasantly, but this is what it
came to&mdash;that in my own proper person I should fall short of
her expectations.&nbsp; For my own sake I felt sorry she had
cried off; it would have been worth something to have met so
sensible a woman.&nbsp; An author introduced to people who have
read&mdash;or who say that they have read&mdash;his books, feels
always like a man taken for the first time to be shown to his
future wife&rsquo;s relations.&nbsp; They are very
pleasant.&nbsp; They try to put him at his ease.&nbsp; But he
knows instinctively they are disappointed with him.&nbsp; I
remember, when a very young man, attending a party at which a
famous American humorist was the chief guest.&nbsp; I was
standing close behind a lady who was talking to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look a bit funny,&rdquo; said the
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; answered her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How did you expect him to look?&nbsp; Did you think he
would have a red nose and a patch over one eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he might look funnier than that,
anyhow,&rdquo; retorted the lady, highly dissatisfied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth coming for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all know the story of the hostess who, leaning across the
table during the dessert, requested of the funny man that he
would kindly say something amusing soon, because the dear
children were waiting to go to bed.&nbsp; Children, I suppose,
have no use for funny people who don&rsquo;t choose to be
funny.&nbsp; I once invited a friend down to my house for a
Saturday to Monday.&nbsp; He is an entertaining man, and before
he came I dilated on his powers of humour&mdash;somewhat
foolishly perhaps&mdash;in the presence of a certain youthful
person who resides with me, and who listens when she
oughtn&rsquo;t to, and never when she ought.&nbsp; He happened
not to be in a humorous mood that evening.&nbsp; My young
relation, after dinner, climbed upon my knee.&nbsp; For quite
five minutes she sat silent.&nbsp; Then she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he said anything funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush.&nbsp; No, not yet; don&rsquo;t be
silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later: &ldquo;Was that funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;can&rsquo;t you hear?&nbsp; We are
talking about Old Age Pensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;oh, never mind now.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t a subject on which one can be funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s he want to talk about it
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for another quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Then,
evidently bored, and much to my relief, suggested herself that
she might as well go to bed.&nbsp; She ran to me the next morning
in the garden with an air of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said something so funny last night,&rdquo; she told
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what was it?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; It seemed to
me I must have missed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t exactly &rsquo;member it,&rdquo;
she explained, &ldquo;not just at the moment.&nbsp; But it was so
funny.&nbsp; I dreamed it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For folks not Lions, but closely related to Lions,
introductions must be trying ordeals.&nbsp; You tell them that
for years you have been yearning to meet them.&nbsp; You assure
them, in a voice trembling with emotion, that this is indeed a
privilege.&nbsp; You go on to add that when a boy&mdash;</p>
<p>At this point they have to interrupt you to explain that they
are not the Mr. So-and-So, but only his cousin or his
grandfather; and all you can think of to say is: &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a nephew who was once the amateur long-distance bicycle
champion.&nbsp; I have him still, but he is stouter and has come
down to a motor car.&nbsp; In sporting circles I was always
introduced as &ldquo;Shorland&rsquo;s Uncle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Close-cropped young men would gaze at me with rapture; and then
inquire: &ldquo;And do you do anything yourself, Mr.
Jerome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my case was not so bad as that of a friend of mine, a
doctor.&nbsp; He married a leading actress, and was known ever
afterwards as &ldquo;Miss B&mdash;&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At public dinners, where one takes one&rsquo;s seat for the
evening next to someone that one possibly has never met before,
and is never likely to meet again, conversation is difficult and
dangerous.&nbsp; I remember talking to a lady at a Vagabond Club
dinner.&nbsp; She asked me during the <i>entree</i>&mdash;with a
light laugh, as I afterwards recalled&mdash;what I thought,
candidly, of the last book of a certain celebrated
authoress.&nbsp; I told her, and a coldness sprang up between
us.&nbsp; She happened to be the certain celebrated authoress;
she had changed her place at the last moment so as to avoid
sitting next to another lady novelist, whom she hated.</p>
<p>One has to shift oneself, sometimes, on these occasions.&nbsp;
A newspaper man came up to me last Ninth of November at the
Mansion House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind changing seats with me?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit awkward.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
put me next to my first wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a troubled evening myself once long ago.&nbsp; I
accompanied a young widow lady to a musical At Home, given by a
lady who had more acquaintances than she knew.&nbsp; We met the
butler at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; My friend spoke first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say Mrs. Dash and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler did not wait for more&mdash;he was a youngish
man&mdash;but shouted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Dash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! how very quiet you have kept!&rdquo; cried our
hostess delighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do let me congratulate
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crush was too great and our hostess too distracted at the
moment for any explanations.&nbsp; We were swept away, and both
of us spent the remainder of the evening feebly protesting our
singleness.</p>
<p>If it had happened on the stage it would have taken us the
whole play to get out of it.&nbsp; Stage people are not allowed
to put things right when mistakes are made with their
identity.&nbsp; If the light comedian is expecting a plumber, the
first man that comes into the drawing-room has got to be a
plumber.&nbsp; He is not allowed to point out that he never was a
plumber; that he doesn&rsquo;t look like a plumber; that no one
not an idiot would mistake him for a plumber.&nbsp; He has got to
be shut up in the bath-room and have water poured over him, just
as if he were a plumber&mdash;a stage plumber, that is.&nbsp; Not
till right away at the end of the last act is he permitted to
remark that he happens to be the new curate.</p>
<p>I sat out a play once at which most people laughed.&nbsp; It
made me sad.&nbsp; A dear old lady entered towards the end of the
first act.&nbsp; We knew she was the aunt.&nbsp; Nobody can
possibly mistake the stage aunt&mdash;except the people on the
stage.&nbsp; They, of course, mistook her for a circus rider, and
shut her up in a cupboard.&nbsp; It is what cupboards seem to be
reserved for on the stage.&nbsp; Nothing is ever put in them
excepting the hero&rsquo;s relations.&nbsp; When she wasn&rsquo;t
in the cupboard she was in a clothes basket, or tied up in a
curtain.&nbsp; All she need have done was to hold on to something
while remarking to the hero:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll stop shouting and jumping about for
just ten seconds, and give me a chance to observe that I am your
maiden aunt from Devonshire, all this tomfoolery can be
avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would have ended it.&nbsp; As a matter of fact that did
end it five minutes past eleven.&nbsp; It hadn&rsquo;t occurred
to her to say it before.</p>
<p>In real life I never knew but of one case where a man suffered
in silence unpleasantness he could have ended with a word; and
that was the case of the late Corney Grain.&nbsp; He had been
engaged to give his entertainment at a country house.&nbsp; The
lady was a <i>nouvelle riche</i> of snobbish instincts.&nbsp; She
left instructions that Corney Grain when he arrived was to dine
with the servants.&nbsp; The butler, who knew better, apologised;
but Corney was a man not easily disconcerted.&nbsp; He dined
well, and after dinner rose and addressed the assembled
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, my good friends,&rdquo; said Corney,
&ldquo;if we have all finished, and if you are all agreeable, I
shall be pleased to present to you my little show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants cheered.&nbsp; The piano was dispensed
with.&nbsp; Corney contrived to amuse his audience very well for
half-an-hour without it.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock came down a
message: Would Mr. Corney Grain come up into the
drawing-room.&nbsp; Corney went.&nbsp; The company in the
drawing-room were waiting, seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready, Mr. Grain,&rdquo; remarked the
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo; demanded Corney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your entertainment,&rdquo; answered the
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have given it already,&rdquo; explained Corney;
&ldquo;and my engagement was for one performance only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given it!&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour ago, downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is nonsense,&rdquo; exclaimed the hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me somewhat unusual,&rdquo; Corney
replied; &ldquo;but it has always been my privilege to dine with
the company I am asked to entertain.&nbsp; I took it you had
arranged a little treat for the servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Corney left to catch his train.</p>
<p>Another entertainer told me the following story, although a
joke against himself.&nbsp; He and Corney Grain were sharing a
cottage on the river.&nbsp; A man called early one morning to
discuss affairs, and was talking to Corney in the parlour, which
was on the ground floor.&nbsp; The window was open.&nbsp; The
other entertainer&mdash;the man who told me the story&mdash;was
dressing in the room above.&nbsp; Thinking he recognised the
voice of the visitor below, he leant out of his bedroom window to
hear better.&nbsp; He leant too far, and dived head foremost into
a bed of flowers, his bare legs&mdash;and only his bare
legs&mdash;showing through the open window of the parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed the visitor, turning at
the moment and seeing a pair of wriggling legs above the window
sill; &ldquo;who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corney fixed his eyeglass and strolled to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only What&rsquo;s-his-name,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful spirits.&nbsp; Can be funny in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>SHOULD
WOMEN BE BEAUTIFUL?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pretty</span> women are going to have a
hard time of it later on.&nbsp; Hitherto, they have had things
far too much their own way.&nbsp; In the future there are going
to be no pretty girls, for the simple reason there will be no
plain girls against which to contrast them.&nbsp; Of late I have
done some systematic reading of ladies&rsquo; papers.&nbsp; The
plain girl submits to a course of &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In eighteen months she bursts upon Society an acknowledged
beauty.&nbsp; And it is all done by kindness.&nbsp; One girl
writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little while ago I used to look at myself in the
glass and cry.&nbsp; Now I look at myself and laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter is accompanied by two photographs of the young
lady.&nbsp; I should have cried myself had I seen her as she was
at first.&nbsp; She was a stumpy, flat-headed, squat-nosed,
cross-eyed thing.&nbsp; She did not even look good.&nbsp; One
virtue she appears to have had, however.&nbsp; It was
faith.&nbsp; She believed what the label said, she did what the
label told her.&nbsp; She is now a tall, ravishing young person,
her only trouble being, I should say, to know what to do with her
hair&mdash;it reaches to her knees and must be a nuisance to
her.&nbsp; She would do better to give some of it away.&nbsp;
Taking this young lady as a text, it means that the girl who
declines to be a dream of loveliness does so out of
obstinacy.&nbsp; What the raw material may be does not appear to
matter.&nbsp; Provided no feature is absolutely missing, the
result is one and the same.</p>
<p>Arrived at years of discretion, the maiden proceeds to choose
the style of beauty she prefers.&nbsp; Will she be a Juno, a
Venus, or a Helen?&nbsp; Will she have a Grecian nose, or one
tip-tilted like the petal of a rose?&nbsp; Let her try the
tip-tilted style first.&nbsp; The professor has an idea it is
going to be fashionable.&nbsp; If afterwards she does not like
it, there will be time to try the Grecian.&nbsp; It is difficult
to decide these points without experiment.</p>
<p>Would the lady like a high or a low forehead?&nbsp; Some
ladies like to look intelligent.&nbsp; It is purely a matter of
taste.&nbsp; With the Grecian nose, the low broad forehead
perhaps goes better.&nbsp; It is more according to
precedent.&nbsp; On the other hand, the high brainy forehead
would be more original.&nbsp; It is for the lady herself to
select.</p>
<p>We come to the question of eyes.&nbsp; The lady fancies a
delicate blue, not too pronounced a colour&mdash;one of those
useful shades that go with almost everything.&nbsp; At the same
time there should be depth and passion.&nbsp; The professor
understands exactly the sort of eye the lady means.&nbsp; But it
will be expensive.&nbsp; There is a cheap quality; the professor
does not recommend it.&nbsp; True that it passes muster by
gaslight, but the sunlight shows it up.&nbsp; It lacks
tenderness, and at the price you can hardly expect it to contain
much hidden meaning.&nbsp; The professor advises the melting,
Oh-George-take-me-in-your-arms-and-still-my-foolish-fears
brand.&nbsp; It costs a little more, but it pays for itself in
the end.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be best, now the eye has been fixed upon, to
discuss the question of the hair.&nbsp; The professor opens his
book of patterns.&nbsp; Maybe the lady is of a wilful
disposition.&nbsp; She loves to run laughing through the woods
during exceptionally rainy weather; or to gallop across the downs
without a hat, her fair ringlets streaming in the wind, the old
family coachman panting and expostulating in the rear.&nbsp; If
one may trust the popular novel, extremely satisfactory husbands
have often been secured in this way.&nbsp; You naturally look at
a girl who is walking through a wood, laughing heartily
apparently for no other reason than because it is
raining&mdash;who rides at stretch gallop without a hat.&nbsp; If
you have nothing else to do, you follow her.&nbsp; It is always
on the cards that such a girl may do something really amusing
before she gets home.&nbsp; Thus things begin.</p>
<p>To a girl of this kind, naturally curly hair is
essential.&nbsp; It must be the sort of hair that looks better
when it is soaking wet.&nbsp; The bottle of stuff that makes this
particular hair to grow may be considered dear, if you think
merely of the price.&nbsp; But that is not the way to look at
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it going to do for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is what the girl has got to ask herself.&nbsp; It does not do to
spoil the ship for a ha&rsquo;porth of tar, as the saying
is.&nbsp; If you are going to be a dashing, wilful beauty, you
must have the hair for it, or the whole scheme falls to the
ground.</p>
<p>Eyebrows and eyelashes, the professor assumes, the lady would
like to match the hair.&nbsp; Too much eccentricity the professor
does not agree with.&nbsp; Nature, after all, is the best guide;
neatness combined with taste, that is the ideal to be aimed
at.&nbsp; The eyebrows should be almost straight, the professor
thinks; the eyelashes long and silky, with just the suspicion of
a curl.&nbsp; The professor would also suggest a little less
cheekbone.&nbsp; Cheekbones are being worn low this season.</p>
<p>Will the lady have a dimpled chin, or does she fancy the
square-cut jaw?&nbsp; Maybe the square-cut jaw and the firm,
sweet mouth are more suitable for the married woman.&nbsp; They
go well enough with the baby and the tea-urn, and the strong,
proud man in the background.&nbsp; For the unmarried girl the
dimpled chin and the rosebud mouth are, perhaps, on the whole
safer.&nbsp; Some gentlemen are so nervous of that firm, square
jaw.&nbsp; For the present, at all events, let us keep to the
rosebud and the dimple.</p>
<p>Complexion!&nbsp; Well, there is only one complexion worth
considering&mdash;a creamy white, relieved by delicate peach
pink.&nbsp; It goes with everything, and is always
effective.&nbsp; Rich olives, striking pallors&mdash;yes, you
hear of these things doing well.&nbsp; The professor&rsquo;s
experience, however, is that for all-round work you will never
improve upon the plain white and pink.&nbsp; It is less liable to
get out of order, and is the easiest at all times to renew.</p>
<p>For the figure, the professor recommends something lithe and
supple.&nbsp; Five foot four is a good height, but that is a
point that should be discussed first with the dressmaker.&nbsp;
For trains, five foot six is, perhaps, preferable.&nbsp; But for
the sporting girl, who has to wear short frocks, that height
would, of course, be impossible.</p>
<p>The bust and the waist are also points on which the dressmaker
should be consulted.&nbsp; Nothing should be done in a
hurry.&nbsp; What is the fashion going to be for the next two or
three seasons?&nbsp; There are styles demanding that beginning at
the neck you should curve out, like a pouter pigeon.&nbsp; There
is apparently no difficulty whatever in obtaining this
result.&nbsp; But if crinolines, for instance, are likely to come
in again!&nbsp; The lady has only to imagine it for herself: the
effect might be grotesque, suggestive of a walking
hour-glass.&nbsp; So, too, with the waist.&nbsp; For some
fashions it is better to have it just a foot from the neck.&nbsp;
At other times it is more useful lower down.&nbsp; The lady will
kindly think over these details and let the professor know.&nbsp;
While one is about it, one may as well make a sound job.</p>
<p>It is all so simple, and, when you come to think of it, really
not expensive.&nbsp; Age, apparently, makes no difference.&nbsp;
A woman is as old as she looks.&nbsp; In future, I take it, there
will be no ladies over five-and-twenty.&nbsp; Wrinkles!&nbsp; Why
any lady should still persist in wearing them is a mystery to
me.&nbsp; With a moderate amount of care any middle-class woman
could save enough out of the housekeeping money in a month to get
rid of every one of them.&nbsp; Grey hair!&nbsp; Well, of course,
if you cling to grey hair, there is no more to be said.&nbsp; But
to ladies who would just as soon have rich wavy-brown or a
delicate shade of gold, I would point out that there are one
hundred and forty-seven inexpensive lotions on the market, any
one of which, rubbed gently into the head with a tooth-brush (not
too hard) just before going to bed will, to use a colloquialism,
do the trick.</p>
<p>Are you too stout, or are you too thin?&nbsp; All you have to
do is to say which, and enclose stamps.&nbsp; But do not make a
mistake and send for the wrong recipe.&nbsp; If you are already
too thin, you might in consequence suddenly disappear before you
found out your mistake.&nbsp; One very stout lady I knew worked
at herself for eighteen months and got stouter every day.&nbsp;
This discouraged her so much that she gave up trying.&nbsp; No
doubt she had made a muddle and had sent for the wrong bottle,
but she would not listen to further advice.&nbsp; She said she
was tired of the whole thing.</p>
<p>In future years there will be no need for a young man to look
about him for a wife; he will take the nearest girl, tell her his
ideal, and, if she really care for him, she will go to the shop
and have herself fixed up to his pattern.&nbsp; In certain
Eastern countries, I believe, something of this kind is
done.&nbsp; A gentleman desirous of adding to his family sends
round the neighbourhood the weight and size of his favourite
wife, hinting that if another can be found of the same
proportions, there is room for her.&nbsp; Fathers walk round
among their daughters, choose the most likely specimen, and have
her fattened up.&nbsp; That is their brutal Eastern way.&nbsp;
Out West we shall be more delicate.&nbsp; Match-making mothers
will probably revive the old confession book.&nbsp; Eligible
bachelors will be invited to fill in a page: &ldquo;Your
favourite height in women,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your favourite
measurement round the waist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you like brunettes
or blondes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The choice will be left to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think Henry William just too sweet for
words,&rdquo; the maiden of the future will murmur to
herself.&nbsp; Gently, coyly, she will draw from him his ideal of
what a woman should be.&nbsp; In from six months to a year she
will burst upon him, the perfect She; height, size, weight, right
to a T.&nbsp; He will clasp her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he will cry, &ldquo;I have found her,
the woman of my dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if he does not change his mind, and the bottles do not
begin to lose their effect, there will be every chance that they
will be happy ever afterwards.</p>
<p>Might not Science go even further?&nbsp; Why rest satisfied
with making a world of merely beautiful women?&nbsp; Cannot
Science, while she is about it, make them all good at the same
time.&nbsp; I do not apologise for the suggestion.&nbsp; I used
to think all women beautiful and good.&nbsp; It is their own
papers that have disillusioned me.&nbsp; I used to look at this
lady or at that&mdash;shyly, when nobody seemed to be noticing
me&mdash;and think how fair she was, how stately.&nbsp; Now I
only wonder who is her chemist.</p>
<p>They used to tell me, when I was a little boy, that girls were
made of sugar and spice.&nbsp; I know better now.&nbsp; I have
read the recipes in the Answers to Correspondents.</p>
<p>When I was quite a young man I used to sit in dark corners and
listen, with swelling heart, while people at the piano told me
where little girl babies got their wonderful eyes from, of the
things they did to them in heaven that gave them dimples.&nbsp;
Ah me!&nbsp; I wish now I had never come across those
ladies&rsquo; papers.&nbsp; I know the stuff that causes those
bewitching eyes.&nbsp; I know the shop where they make those
dimples; I have passed it and looked in.&nbsp; I thought they
were produced by angels&rsquo; kisses, but there was not an angel
about the place, that I could see.&nbsp; Perhaps I have also been
deceived as regards their goodness.&nbsp; Maybe all women are not
so perfect as in the popular short story they appear to be.&nbsp;
That is why I suggest that Science should proceed still further,
and make them all as beautiful in mind as she is now able to make
them in body.&nbsp; May we not live to see in the advertisement
columns of the ladies&rsquo; paper of the future the portrait of
a young girl sulking in a corner&mdash;&ldquo;Before taking the
lotion!&rdquo;&nbsp; The same girl dancing among her little
brothers and sisters, shedding sunlight through the
home&mdash;&ldquo;After the three first bottles!&rdquo;&nbsp; May
we not have the Caudle Mixture: One tablespoonful at bed-time
guaranteed to make the lady murmur, &ldquo;Good-night, dear; hope
you&rsquo;ll sleep well,&rdquo; and at once to fall asleep, her
lips parted in a smile?&nbsp; Maybe some specialist of the future
will advertise Mind Massage: &ldquo;Warranted to remove from the
most obstinate subject all traces of hatred, envy, and
malice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, when Science has done everything possible for women,
there might be no harm in her turning her attention to us
men.&nbsp; Her idea at present seems to be that we men are too
beautiful, physically and morally, to need improvement.&nbsp;
Personally, there are one or two points about which I should like
to consult her.</p>
<h2><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>WHEN
IS THE BEST TIME TO BE MERRY?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is so much I could do to
improve things generally in and about Europe, if only I had a
free hand.&nbsp; I should not propose any great fundamental
changes.&nbsp; These poor people have got used to their own ways;
it would be unwise to reform them all at once.&nbsp; But there
are many little odds and ends that I could do for them, so many
of their mistakes I could correct for them.&nbsp; They do not
know this.&nbsp; If they only knew there was a man living in
their midst willing to take them in hand and arrange things for
them, how glad they would be.&nbsp; But the story is always the
same.&nbsp; One reads it in the advertisements of the matrimonial
column:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady, young, said to be good-looking&rdquo;&mdash;she
herself is not sure on the point; she feels that possibly she may
be prejudiced; she puts before you merely the current gossip of
the neighbourhood; people say she is beautiful; they may be
right, they may be wrong: it is not for her to
decide&mdash;&ldquo;well-educated, of affectionate disposition,
possessed of means, desires to meet gentleman with a view to
matrimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately underneath one reads of a gentleman of
twenty-eight, &ldquo;tall, fair, considered
agreeable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really the modesty of the matrimonial
advertiser teaches to us ordinary mortals quite a beautiful
lesson.&nbsp; I know instinctively that were anybody to ask me
suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call yourself an agreeable man?&rdquo; I should
answer promptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An agreeable man!&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;m an
agreeable man.&nbsp; What silly questions you do
ask!&rdquo;&nbsp; If he persisted in arguing the matter,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are people who do not consider you an
agreeable man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should get angry with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they think that, do they?&rdquo; I should
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you tell them from me, with my
compliments, that they are a set of blithering idiots.&nbsp; Not
agreeable!&nbsp; You show me the man who says I&rsquo;m not
agreeable.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon let him know whether I&rsquo;m
agreeable or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These young men seeking a wife are silent on the subject of
their own virtues.&nbsp; Such are for others to discover.&nbsp;
The matrimonial advertiser confines himself to a simple statement
of fact: &ldquo;he is considered agreeable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
domestically inclined, and in receipt of a good income.&nbsp; He
is desirous of meeting a lady of serious disposition, with view
to matrimony.&nbsp; If possessed of means&mdash;well, it is a
trifle hardly worth considering one way or the other.&nbsp; He
does not insist upon it; on the other hand he does not exclude
ladies of means; the main idea is matrimony.</p>
<p>It is sad to reflect upon a young lady, said to be
good-looking (let us say good-looking and be done with it: a
neighbourhood does not rise up and declare a girl good-looking if
she is not good-looking, that is only her modest way of putting
it), let us say a young lady, good-looking, well-educated, of
affectionate disposition&mdash;it is undeniably sad to reflect
that such an one, matrimonially inclined, should be compelled to
have recourse to the columns of a matrimonial journal.&nbsp; What
are the young men in the neighbourhood thinking of?&nbsp; What
more do they want?&nbsp; Is it Venus come to life again with ten
thousand a year that they are waiting for!&nbsp; It makes me
angry with my own sex reading these advertisements.&nbsp; And
when one thinks of the girls that do get married!</p>
<p>But life is a mystery.&nbsp; The fact remains: here is the
ideal wife seeking in vain for a husband.&nbsp; And here,
immediately underneath&mdash;I will not say the ideal husband, he
may have faults; none of us are perfect, but as men go a decided
acquisition to any domestic hearth, an agreeable gentleman, fond
of home life, none of your gad-abouts&mdash;calls aloud to the
four winds for a wife&mdash;any sort of a wife, provided she be
of a serious disposition.&nbsp; In his despair, he has grown
indifferent to all other considerations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there in
this world,&rdquo; he has said to himself, &ldquo;one unmarried
woman, willing to marry me, an agreeable man, in receipt of a
good income.&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly enough this twain have passed
one another in the street, have sat side by side in the same
tram-car, never guessing, each one, that the other was the very
article of which they were in want to make life beautiful.</p>
<p>Mistresses in search of a servant, not so much with the idea
of getting work out of her, rather with the object of making her
happy, advertise on one page.&nbsp; On the opposite page,
domestic treasures&mdash;disciples of Carlyle, apparently, with a
passionate love of work for its own sake&mdash;are seeking
situations, not so much with the desire of gain as with the hope
of finding openings where they may enjoy the luxury of feeling
they are leading useful lives.&nbsp; These philanthropic
mistresses, these toil-loving hand-maidens, have lived side by
side in the same town for years, never knowing one another.</p>
<p>So it is with these poor European peoples.&nbsp; They pass me
in the street.&nbsp; They do not guess that I am ready and
willing to take them under my care, to teach them common sense
with a smattering of intelligence&mdash;to be, as one might say,
a father to them.&nbsp; They look at me.&nbsp; There is nothing
about me to tell them that I know what is good for them better
than they do themselves.&nbsp; In the fairy tales the wise man
wore a conical hat and a long robe with twiddly things all round
the edge.&nbsp; You knew he was a clever man.&nbsp; It avoided
the necessity of explanation.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the fashion
has gone out.&nbsp; We wise men have to wear just ordinary
clothes.&nbsp; Nobody knows we are wise men.&nbsp; Even when we
tell them so, they don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; This it is that
makes our task the more difficult.</p>
<p>One of the first things I should take in hand, were European
affairs handed over to my control, would be the rearrangement of
the Carnival.&nbsp; As matters are, the Carnival takes place all
over Europe in February.&nbsp; At Nice, in Spain, or in Italy, it
may be occasionally possible to feel you want to dance about the
streets in thin costume during February.&nbsp; But in more
northern countries during Carnival time I have seen only one
sensible masker; he was a man who had got himself up as a
diver.&nbsp; It was in Antwerp.&nbsp; The rain was pouring down
in torrents; a cheery, boisterous John Bull sort of an east wind
was blustering through the streets at the rate of fifteen miles
an hour.&nbsp; Pierrots, with frozen hands, were blowing blue
noses.&nbsp; An elderly Cupid had borrowed an umbrella from a
caf&eacute; and was waiting for a tram.&nbsp; A very little devil
was crying with the cold, and wiping his eyes with the end of his
own tail.&nbsp; Every doorway was crowded with shivering
maskers.&nbsp; The diver alone walked erect, the water streaming
from him.</p>
<p>February is not the month for open air masquerading.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;confetti,&rdquo; which has come to be nothing but coloured
paper cut into small discs, is a sodden mass.&nbsp; When a lump
of it strikes you in the eye, your instinct is not to laugh
gaily, but to find out the man who threw it and to hit him
back.&nbsp; This is not the true spirit of Carnival.&nbsp; The
marvel is that, in spite of the almost invariably adverse
weather, these Carnivals still continue.&nbsp; In Belgium, where
Romanism still remains the dominant religion, Carnival maintains
itself stronger than elsewhere in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>At one small town, Binche, near the French border, it holds
uninterrupted sway for three days and two nights, during which
time the whole of the population, swelled by visitors from twenty
miles round, shouts, romps, eats and drinks and dances.&nbsp;
After which the visitors are packed like sardines into railway
trains.&nbsp; They pin their tickets to their coats and promptly
go to sleep.&nbsp; At every station the railway officials stumble
up and down the trains with lanterns.&nbsp; The last feeble
effort of the more wakeful reveller, before he adds himself to
the heap of snoring humanity on the floor of the railway
carriage, is to change the tickets of a couple of his unconscious
companions.&nbsp; In this way gentlemen for the east are dragged
out by the legs at junctions, and packed into trains going west;
while southern fathers are shot out in the chill dawn at lonely
northern stations, to find themselves greeted with enthusiasm by
other people&rsquo;s families.</p>
<p>At Binche, they say&mdash;I have not counted them
myself&mdash;that thirty thousand maskers can be seen dancing at
the same time.&nbsp; When they are not dancing they are throwing
oranges at one another.&nbsp; The houses board up their
windows.&nbsp; The restaurants take down their mirrors and hide
away the glasses.&nbsp; If I went masquerading at Binche I should
go as a man in armour, period Henry the Seventh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it hurt,&rdquo; I asked a lady who had
been there, &ldquo;having oranges thrown at you?&nbsp; Which sort
do they use, speaking generally, those fine juicy
ones&mdash;Javas I think you call them&mdash;or the little hard
brand with skins like a nutmeg-grater?&nbsp; And if both sorts
are used indiscriminately, which do you personally
prefer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smart people,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;they are
the same everywhere&mdash;they must be extravagant&mdash;they use
the Java orange.&nbsp; If it hits you in the back I prefer the
Java orange.&nbsp; It is more messy than the other, but it does
not leave you with that curious sensation of having been
temporarily stunned.&nbsp; Most people, of course, make use of
the small hard orange.&nbsp; If you duck in time, and so catch it
on the top of your head, it does not hurt so much as you would
think.&nbsp; If, however, it hits you on a tender
place&mdash;well, myself, I always find that a little sal
volatile, with old cognac&mdash;half and half, you
understand&mdash;is about the best thing.&nbsp; But it only
happens once a year,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Nearly every town gives prizes for the best group of
maskers.&nbsp; In some cases the first prize amounts to as much
as two hundred pounds.&nbsp; The butchers, the bakers, the
candlestick makers, join together and compete.&nbsp; They arrive
in wagons, each group with its band.&nbsp; Free trade is
encouraged.&nbsp; Each neighbouring town and village
&ldquo;dumps&rdquo; its load of picturesque merry-makers.</p>
<p>It is in these smaller towns that the spirit of King Carnival
finds happiest expression.&nbsp; Almost every third inhabitant
takes part in the fun.&nbsp; In Brussels and the larger towns the
thing appears ridiculous.&nbsp; A few hundred maskers force their
way with difficulty through thousands of dull-clad spectators,
looking like a Spanish river in the summer time, a feeble stream,
dribbling through acres of muddy bank.&nbsp; At Charleroi, the
centre of the Belgian Black Country, the chief feature of the
Carnival is the dancing of the children.&nbsp; A space is
specially roped off for them.</p>
<p>If by chance the sun is kind enough to shine, the sight is a
pretty one.&nbsp; How they love the dressing up and the acting,
these small mites!&nbsp; One young hussy&mdash;she could hardly
have been more than ten&mdash;was gotten up as a haughty young
lady.&nbsp; Maybe some elder sister had served as a model.&nbsp;
She wore a tremendous wig of flaxen hair, a hat that I guarantee
would have made its mark even at Ascot on the Cup Day, a skirt
that trailed two yards behind her, a pair of what had once been
white kid gloves, and a blue silk parasol.&nbsp; Dignity!&nbsp; I
have seen the offended barmaid, I have met the chorus
girl&mdash;not by appointment, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand
me, merely as a spectator&mdash;up the river on Sunday.&nbsp; But
never have I witnessed in any human being so much hauteur to the
pound <i>avoir-dupois</i> as was carried through the streets of
Charleroi by that small brat.&nbsp; Companions of other days,
mere vulgar boys and girls, claimed acquaintance with her.&nbsp;
She passed them with a stare of such utter disdain that it sent
them tumbling over one another backwards.&nbsp; By the time they
had recovered themselves sufficiently to think of an old tin
kettle lying handy in the gutter she had turned the corner.</p>
<p>Two miserably clad urchins, unable to scrape together the few
<i>sous</i> necessary for the hire of a rag or two, had
nevertheless determined not to be altogether out of it.&nbsp;
They had managed to borrow a couple of white blouses&mdash;not
what you would understand by a white blouse, dear Madame, a
dainty thing of frills and laces, but the coarse white sack the
street sweeper wears over his clothes.&nbsp; They had also
borrowed a couple of brooms.&nbsp; Ridiculous little objects they
looked, the tiny head of each showing above the great white
shroud as gravely they walked, the one behind the other, sweeping
the mud into the gutter.&nbsp; They also were of the Carnival,
playing at being scavengers.</p>
<p>Another quaint sight I witnessed.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;serpentin&rdquo; is a feature of the Belgian
Carnival.&nbsp; It is a strip of coloured paper, some dozen yards
long, perhaps.&nbsp; You fling it as you would a lassoo,
entangling the head of some passer-by.&nbsp; Naturally, the
object most aimed at by the Belgian youth is the Belgian
maiden.&nbsp; And, naturally also, the maiden who finds herself
most entangled is the maiden who&mdash;to use again the language
of the matrimonial advertiser&mdash;&ldquo;is considered
good-looking.&rdquo;&nbsp; The serpentin about her head is the
&ldquo;feather in her cap&rdquo; of the Belgian maiden on
Carnival Day.&nbsp; Coming suddenly round the corner I almost ran
into a girl.&nbsp; Her back was towards me.&nbsp; It was a quiet
street.&nbsp; She had half a dozen of these serpentins.&nbsp;
Hurriedly, with trembling hands, she was twisting them round and
round her own head.&nbsp; I looked at her as I passed.&nbsp; She
flushed scarlet.&nbsp; Poor little snub-nosed pasty-faced
woman!&nbsp; I wish she had not seen me.&nbsp; I could have
bought sixpenny-worth, followed her, and tormented her with them;
while she would have pretended indignation&mdash;sought,
discreetly, to escape from me.</p>
<p>Down South, where the blood flows quicker, King Carnival is,
indeed, a jolly old soul.&nbsp; In Munich he reigns for six
weeks, the end coming with a mad two days revel in the
streets.&nbsp; During the whole of the period, folks in ordinary,
every-day costume are regarded as curiosities; people wonder what
they are up to.&nbsp; From the Grafin to the Dienstm&auml;dchen,
from the Herr Professor to the &ldquo;Piccolo,&rdquo; as they
term the small artist that answers to our page boy, the business
of Munich is dancing, somewhere, somehow, in a fancy
costume.&nbsp; Every theatre clears away the stage, every
caf&eacute; crowds its chairs and tables into corners, the very
streets are cleared for dancing.&nbsp; Munich goes mad.</p>
<p>Munich is always a little mad.&nbsp; The maddest ball I ever
danced at was in Munich.&nbsp; I went there with a Harvard
University professor.&nbsp; He had been told what these balls
were like.&nbsp; Ever seeking knowledge of all things, he
determined to take the matter up for himself and examine
it.&nbsp; The writer also must ever be learning.&nbsp; I agreed
to accompany him.&nbsp; We had not intended to dance.&nbsp; Our
idea was that we could be indulgent spectators, regarding from
some coign of vantage the antics of the foolish crowd.&nbsp; The
professor was clad as became a professor.&nbsp; Myself, I wore a
simply-cut frock-coat, with trousering in French grey.&nbsp; The
doorkeeper explained to us that this was a costume ball; he was
sorry, but gentlemen could only be admitted in evening dress or
in masquerade.</p>
<p>It was half past one in the morning.&nbsp; We had sat up late
on purpose; we had gone without our dinner; we had walked two
miles.&nbsp; The professor suggested pinning up the tails of his
clerically-cut coat and turning in his waistcoat.&nbsp; The
doorkeeper feared it would not be quite the same thing.&nbsp;
Besides, my French grey trousers refused to adapt
themselves.&nbsp; The doorkeeper proposed our hiring a
costume&mdash;a little speculation of his own; gentlemen found it
simpler sometimes, especially married gentlemen, to hire a
costume in this manner, changing back into sober garments before
returning home.&nbsp; It reduced the volume of necessary
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything, my good man,&rdquo; said the
professor, &ldquo;anything that would effect a complete
disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorkeeper had the very thing&mdash;a Chinese arrangement,
with combined mask and wig.&nbsp; It fitted neatly over the head,
and was provided with a simple but ingenious piece of mechanism
by means of which much could be done with the pigtail.&nbsp;
Myself the doorkeeper hid from view under the cowl of a Carmelite
monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope nobody recognises us,&rdquo; whispered my
friend the professor as we entered.</p>
<p>I can only hope sincerely that they did not.&nbsp; I do not
wish to talk about myself.&nbsp; That would be egotism.&nbsp; But
the mystery of the professor troubles me to this day.&nbsp; A
grave, earnest gentleman, the father of a family, I saw him with
my own eyes put that ridiculous pasteboard mask over his
head.&nbsp; Later on&mdash;a good deal later on&mdash;I found
myself walking again with him through silent star-lit
streets.&nbsp; Where he had been in the interval, and who then
was the strange creature under the Chinaman&rsquo;s mask, will
always remain to me an unsolved problem.</p>
<h2><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>DO WE
LIE A-BED TOO LATE?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in Paris, many years ago,
that I fell by chance into this habit of early rising.&nbsp; My
night&mdash;by reasons that I need not enter into&mdash;had been
a troubled one.&nbsp; Tired of the hot bed that gave no sleep, I
rose and dressed myself, crept down the creaking stairs,
experiencing the sensations of a burglar new to his profession,
unbolted the great door of the hotel, and passed out into an
unknown, silent city, bathed in a mysterious soft light.&nbsp;
Since then, this strange sweet city of the dawn has never ceased
to call to me.&nbsp; It may be in London, in Paris again, in
Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, that I have gone to sleep, but if
perchance I wake before the returning tide of human life has
dimmed its glories with the mists and vapours of the noisy day, I
know that beyond my window blind the fairy city, as I saw it
first so many years ago&mdash;this city that knows no tears, no
sorrow, through which there creeps no evil thing; this city of
quiet vistas, fading into hope; this city of far-off voices
whispering peace; this city of the dawn that still is
young&mdash;invites me to talk with it awhile before the waking
hours drive it before them, and with a sigh it passes whence it
came.</p>
<p>It is the great city&rsquo;s one hour of purity, of
dignity.&nbsp; The very rag-picker, groping with her filthy hands
among the ashes, instead of an object of contempt, moves from
door to door an accusing Figure, her thin soiled garments, her
bent body, her scarred face, hideous with the wounds of poverty,
an eloquent indictment of smug Injustice, sleeping behind its
deaf shutters.&nbsp; Yet even into her dim brain has sunk the
peace that fills for this brief hour the city.&nbsp; This, too,
shall have its end, my sister!&nbsp; Men and women were not born
to live on the husks that fill the pails outside the rich
man&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Courage a little while longer, you and
yours.&nbsp; Your rheumy eyes once were bright, your thin locks
once soft and wavy, your poor bent back once straight; and maybe,
as they tell you in their gilded churches, this bulging sack
shall be lifted from your weary shoulders, your misshapen limbs
be straight again.&nbsp; You pass not altogether unheeded through
these empty streets.&nbsp; Not all the eyes of the universe are
sleeping.</p>
<p>The little seamstress, hurrying to her early work!&nbsp; A
little later she will be one of the foolish crowd, joining in the
foolish laughter, in the coarse jests of the work-room: but as
yet the hot day has not claimed her.&nbsp; The work-room is far
beyond, the home of mean cares and sordid struggles far
behind.&nbsp; To her, also, in this moment are the sweet thoughts
of womanhood.&nbsp; She puts down her bag, rests herself upon a
seat.&nbsp; If all the day were dawn, this city of the morning
always with us!&nbsp; A neighbouring clock chimes forth the
hour.&nbsp; She starts up from her dream and hurries on&mdash;to
the noisy work-room.</p>
<p>A pair of lovers cross the park, holding each other&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; They will return later in the day, but there will be
another expression in their eyes, another meaning in the pressure
of their hands.&nbsp; Now the purity of the morning is with
them.</p>
<p>Some fat, middle-aged clerk comes puffing into view: his
ridiculous little figure very podgy.&nbsp; He stops to take off
his hat and mop his bald head with his handkerchief: even to him
the morning lends romance.&nbsp; His fleshy face changes almost
as one looks at him.&nbsp; One sees again the lad with his vague
hopes, his absurd ambitions.</p>
<p>There is a statue of Aphrodite in one of the smaller Paris
parks.&nbsp; Twice in the same week, without particularly meaning
it, I found myself early in the morning standing in front of this
statue gazing listlessly at it, as one does when in dreamy mood;
and on both occasions, turning to go, I encountered the same man,
also gazing at it with, apparently, listless eyes.&nbsp; He was
an uninteresting looking man&mdash;possibly he thought the same
of me.&nbsp; From his dress he might have been a well-to-do
tradesman, a minor Government official, doctor, or lawyer.&nbsp;
Quite ten years later I paid my third visit to the same statue at
about the same hour.&nbsp; This time he was there before
me.&nbsp; I was hidden from him by some bushes.&nbsp; He glanced
round but did not see me; and then he did a curious thing.&nbsp;
Placing his hands on the top of the pedestal, which may have been
some seven feet in height, he drew himself up, and kissed very
gently, almost reverentially, the foot of the statue, begrimed
though it was with the city&rsquo;s dirt.&nbsp; Had he been some
long-haired student of the Latin Quarter one would not have been
so astonished.&nbsp; But he was such a very commonplace, quite
respectable looking man.&nbsp; Afterwards he drew a pipe from his
pocket, carefully filled and lighted it, took his umbrella from
the seat where it had been lying, and walked away.</p>
<p>Had it been their meeting-place long ago?&nbsp; Had he been
wont to tell her, gazing at her with lover&rsquo;s eyes, how like
she was to the statue?&nbsp; The French sculptor has not to
consider Mrs. Grundy.&nbsp; Maybe, the lady, raising her eyes,
had been confused; perhaps for a moment angry&mdash;some little
milliner or governess, one supposes.&nbsp; In France the <i>jeune
fille</i> of good family does not meet her lover
unattended.&nbsp; What had happened?&nbsp; Or was it but the
vagrant fancy of a middle-aged bourgeois seeking in imagination
the romance that reality so rarely gives us, weaving his love
dream round his changeless statue?</p>
<p>In one of Ibsen&rsquo;s bitter comedies the lovers agree to
part while they are still young, never to see each other in the
flesh again.&nbsp; Into the future each will bear away the image
of the other, godlike, radiant with the glory of youth and love;
each will cherish the memory of a loved one who shall be
beautiful always.&nbsp; That their parting may not appear such
wild nonsense as at first it strikes us, Ibsen shows us other
lovers who have married in the orthodox fashion.&nbsp; She was
all that a mistress should be.&nbsp; They speak of her as they
first knew her fifteen years ago, when every man was at her
feet.&nbsp; He then was a young student, burning with fine
ideals, with enthusiasm for all the humanities.</p>
<p>They enter.</p>
<p>What did you expect?&nbsp; Fifteen years have
passed&mdash;fifteen years of struggle with the grim
realities.&nbsp; He is fat and bald.&nbsp; Eleven children have
to be provided for.&nbsp; High ideals will not even pay the
bootmaker.&nbsp; To exist you have to fight for mean ends with
mean weapons.&nbsp; And the sweet girl heroine!&nbsp; Now the
worried mother of eleven brats!&nbsp; One rings down the curtain
amid Satanic laughter.</p>
<p>That is why, for one reason among so many, I love this mystic
morning light.&nbsp; It has a strange power of revealing the
beauty that is hidden from us by the coarser beams of the full
day.&nbsp; These worn men and women, grown so foolish looking, so
unromantic; these artisans and petty clerks plodding to their
monotonous day&rsquo;s work; these dull-eyed women of the people
on their way to market to haggle over <i>sous</i>, to argue and
contend over paltry handfuls of food.&nbsp; In this magic morning
light the disguising body becomes transparent.&nbsp; They have
grown beautiful, not ugly, with the years of toil and hardship;
these lives, lived so patiently, are consecrated to the service
of the world.&nbsp; Joy, hope, pleasure&mdash;they have done with
all such, life for them is over.&nbsp; Yet they labour,
ceaselessly, uncomplainingly.&nbsp; It is for the children.</p>
<p>One morning, near Brussels, I encountered a cart of faggots,
drawn by a hound so lean that stroking him might have hurt a
dainty hand.&nbsp; I was shocked&mdash;angry, till I noticed his
fellow beast of burden pushing the cart from behind.&nbsp; Such a
scarecrow of an old woman!&nbsp; There was little to choose
between them.&nbsp; I walked with them a little way.&nbsp; She
lived near Waterloo.&nbsp; All day she gathered wood in the great
forest, and starting at three o&rsquo;clock each morning, the two
lean creatures between them dragged the cart nine miles to
Brussels, returning when they had sold their load.&nbsp; With
luck she might reckon on a couple of francs.&nbsp; I asked her if
she could not find something else to do.</p>
<p>Yes, it was possible, but for the little one, her
grandchild.&nbsp; Folks will not employ old women burdened with
grandchildren.</p>
<p>You fair, dainty ladies, who would never know it was morning
if somebody did not enter to pull up the blind and tell you
so!&nbsp; You do well not to venture out in this magic morning
light.&nbsp; You would look so plain&mdash;almost ugly, by the
side of these beautiful women.</p>
<p>It is curious the attraction the Church has always possessed
for the marketing classes.&nbsp; Christ drove them from the
Temple, but still, in every continental city, they cluster round
its outer walls.&nbsp; It makes a charming picture on a sunny
morning, the great cathedral with its massive shadow forming the
background; splashed about its feet, like a parterre of gay
flowers around the trunk of some old tree, the women, young girls
in their many coloured costumes, sitting before their piled-up
baskets of green vegetables, of shining fruits.</p>
<p>In Brussels the chief market is held on the Grande
Place.&nbsp; The great gilded houses have looked down upon much
the same scene every morning these four hundred years.&nbsp; In
summer time it commences about half-past four; by five
o&rsquo;clock it is a roaring hive, the great city round about
still sleeping.</p>
<p>Here comes the thrifty housewife of the poor, to whom the
difference of a tenth of a penny in the price of a cabbage is
all-important, and the much harassed keeper of the petty
<i>pension</i>.&nbsp; There are houses in Brussels where they
will feed you, light you, sleep you, wait on you, for two francs
a day.&nbsp; Withered old ladies, ancient governesses, who will
teach you for forty centimes an hour, gather round these ricketty
tables, wolf up the thin soup, grumble at the watery coffee, help
themselves with unladylike greediness to the potato pie.&nbsp; It
must need careful housewifery to keep these poor creatures on two
francs a day and make a profit for yourself.&nbsp; So
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; the much-grumbled-at, who has gone to bed
about twelve, rises a little before five, makes her way down with
her basket.&nbsp; Thus a few <i>sous</i> may be saved upon the
day&rsquo;s economies.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a mere child who is the little
housekeeper.&nbsp; One thinks that perhaps this early training in
the art of haggling may not be good for her.&nbsp; Already there
is a hard expression in the childish eyes, mean lines about the
little mouth.&nbsp; The finer qualities of humanity are expensive
luxuries, not to be afforded by the poor.</p>
<p>They overwork their patient dogs, and underfeed them.&nbsp;
During the two hours&rsquo; market the poor beasts, still
fastened to their little &ldquo;chariots,&rdquo; rest in the open
space about the neighbouring Bourse.&nbsp; They snatch at what
you throw them; they do not even thank you with a wag of the
tail.&nbsp; Gratitude!&nbsp; Politeness!&nbsp; What mean
you?&nbsp; We have not heard of such.&nbsp; We only work.&nbsp;
Some of them amid all the din lie sleeping between their
shafts.&nbsp; Some are licking one another&rsquo;s sores.&nbsp;
One would they were better treated; alas! their owners, likewise,
are overworked and underfed, housed in kennels no better.&nbsp;
But if the majority in every society were not overworked and
underfed and meanly housed, why, then the minority could not be
underworked and overfed and housed luxuriously.&nbsp; But this is
talk to which no respectable reader can be expected to
listen.</p>
<p>They are one babel of bargaining, these markets.&nbsp; The
purchaser selects a cauliflower.&nbsp; Fortunately, cauliflowers
have no feelings, or probably it would burst into tears at the
expression with which it is regarded.&nbsp; It is impossible that
any lady should desire such a cauliflower.&nbsp; Still, out of
mere curiosity, she would know the price&mdash;that is, if the
owner of the cauliflower is not too much ashamed of it to name a
price.</p>
<p>The owner of the cauliflower suggests six <i>sous</i>.&nbsp;
The thing is too ridiculous for argument.&nbsp; The purchaser
breaks into a laugh.</p>
<p>The owner of the cauliflower is stung.&nbsp; She points out
the beauties of that cauliflower.&nbsp; Apparently it is the
cauliflower out of all her stock she loves the best; a better
cauliflower never lived; if there were more cauliflowers in the
world like this particular cauliflower things might be
different.&nbsp; She gives a sketch of the cauliflower&rsquo;s
career, from its youth upwards.&nbsp; Hard enough it will be for
her when the hour for parting from it comes.&nbsp; If the other
lady has not sufficient knowledge of cauliflowers to appreciate
it, will she kindly not paw it about, but put it down and go
away, and never let the owner of the cauliflower see her
again.</p>
<p>The other lady, more as a friend than as a purchaser, points
out the cauliflower&rsquo;s defects.&nbsp; She wishes well to the
owner of the cauliflower, and would like to teach her something
about her business.&nbsp; A lady who thinks such a cauliflower
worth six <i>sous</i> can never hope to succeed as a cauliflower
vendor.&nbsp; Has she really taken the trouble to examine the
cauliflower for herself, or has love made her blind to its
shortcomings?</p>
<p>The owner of the cauliflower is too indignant to reply.&nbsp;
She snatches it away, appears to be comforting it, replaces it in
the basket.&nbsp; The other lady is grieved at human obstinacy
and stupidity in general.&nbsp; If the owner of the cauliflower
had had any sense she would have asked four <i>sous</i>.&nbsp;
Eventually business is done at five.</p>
<p>It is the custom everywhere abroad&mdash;asking the price of a
thing is simply opening conversation.&nbsp; A lady told me that,
the first day she began housekeeping in Florence, she handed over
to a poulterer for a chicken the price he had demanded&mdash;with
protestations that he was losing on the transaction, but wanted,
for family reasons, apparently, to get rid of the chicken.&nbsp;
He stood for half a minute staring at her, and then, being an
honest sort of man, threw in a pigeon.</p>
<p>Foreign housekeepers starting business in London appear hurt
when our tradesmen decline to accept half-a-crown for articles
marked three-and-six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why mark it only three-and-sixpence?&rdquo; is the
foreign housekeeper&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>SHOULD
MARRIED MEN PLAY GOLF?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> we Englishmen attach too much
importance to sport goes without saying&mdash;or, rather, it has
been said so often as to have become a commonplace.&nbsp; One of
these days some reforming English novelist will write a book,
showing the evil effects of over-indulgence in sport: the
neglected business, the ruined home, the slow but sure sapping of
the brain&mdash;what there may have been of it in the
beginning&mdash;leading to semi-imbecility and yearly increasing
obesity.</p>
<p>A young couple, I once heard of, went for their honeymoon to
Scotland.&nbsp; The poor girl did not know he was a golfer (he
had wooed and won her during a period of idleness enforced by a
sprained shoulder), or maybe she would have avoided
Scotland.&nbsp; The idea they started with was that of a
tour.&nbsp; The second day the man went out for a stroll by
himself.&nbsp; At dinner-time he observed, with a far-away look
in his eyes, that it seemed a pretty spot they had struck, and
suggested their staying there another day.&nbsp; The next morning
after breakfast he borrowed a club from the hotel porter, and
remarked that he would take a walk while she finished doing her
hair.&nbsp; He said it amused him, swinging a club while he
walked.&nbsp; He returned in time for lunch and seemed moody all
the afternoon.&nbsp; He said the air suited him, and urged that
they should linger yet another day.</p>
<p>She was young and inexperienced, and thought, maybe, it was
liver.&nbsp; She had heard much about liver from her
father.&nbsp; The next morning he borrowed more clubs, and went
out, this time before breakfast, returning to a late and not over
sociable dinner.&nbsp; That was the end of their honeymoon so far
as she was concerned.&nbsp; He meant well, but the thing had gone
too far.&nbsp; The vice had entered into his blood, and the smell
of the links drove out all other considerations.</p>
<p>We are most of us familiar, I take it, with the story of the
golfing parson, who could not keep from swearing when the balls
went wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golf and the ministry don&rsquo;t seem to go
together,&rdquo; his friend told him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take my advice
before it&rsquo;s too late, and give it up, Tammas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few months later Tammas met his friend again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, Jamie,&rdquo; cried the parson
cheerily, &ldquo;they didna run well in harness; golf and the
meenistry, I hae followed your advice: I hae gi&rsquo;en it
oop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are ye doing with that sack of clubs?&rdquo;
inquired Jamie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I doing with them?&rdquo; repeated the puzzled
Tammas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why I am going to play golf with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; A light broke upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great
Heavens, man!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;ye didna&rsquo; think
&rsquo;twas the golf I&rsquo;d gi&rsquo;en oop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman does not understand play.&nbsp; He makes a
life-long labour of his sport, and to it sacrifices mind and
body.&nbsp; The health resorts of Europe&mdash;to paraphrase a
famous saying that nobody appears to have said&mdash;draw half
their profits from the playing fields of Eton and
elsewhere.&nbsp; In Swiss and German kurhausen enormously fat men
bear down upon you and explain to you that once they were the
champion sprinters or the high-jump representatives of their
university&mdash;men who now hold on to the bannisters and groan
as they haul themselves upstairs.&nbsp; Consumptive men, between
paroxysms of coughing, tell you of the goals they scored when
they were half-backs or forwards of extraordinary ability.&nbsp;
Ex-light-weight amateur pugilists, with the figure now of an
American roll-top desk, butt you into a corner of the
billiard-room, and, surprised they cannot get as near you as they
would desire, whisper to you the secret of avoiding the undercut
by the swiftness of the backward leap.&nbsp; Broken-down tennis
players, one-legged skaters, dropsical gentlemen-riders, are to
be met with hobbling on crutches along every highway of the
Engadine.</p>
<p>They are pitiable objects.&nbsp; Never having learnt to read
anything but the sporting papers, books are of no use to
them.&nbsp; They never wasted much of their youth on thought,
and, apparently, have lost the knack of it.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t care for art, and Nature only suggests to them the
things they can no longer do.&nbsp; The snow-clad mountain
reminds them that once they were daring tobogannists; the
undulating common makes them sad because they can no longer
handle a golf-club; by the riverside they sit down and tell you
of the salmon they caught before they caught rheumatic fever;
birds only make them long for guns; music raises visions of the
local cricket-match of long ago, enlivened by the local band; a
picturesque estaminet, with little tables spread out under the
vines, recalls bitter memories of ping-pong.&nbsp; One is sorry
for them, but their conversation is not exhilarating.&nbsp; The
man who has other interests in life beyond sport is apt to find
their reminiscences monotonous; while to one another they do not
care to talk.&nbsp; One gathers that they do not altogether
believe one another.</p>
<p>The foreigner is taking kindly to our sports; one hopes he
will be forewarned by our example and not overdo the thing.&nbsp;
At present, one is bound to admit, he shows no sign of taking
sport too seriously.&nbsp; Football is gaining favour more and
more throughout Europe.&nbsp; But yet the Frenchman has not got
it out of his head that the <i>coup</i> to practise is kicking
the ball high into the air and catching it upon his head.&nbsp;
He would rather catch the ball upon his head than score a
goal.&nbsp; If he can man&oelig;uvre the ball away into a corner,
kick it up into the air twice running, and each time catch it on
his head, he does not seem to care what happens after that.&nbsp;
Anybody can have the ball; he has had his game and is happy.</p>
<p>They talk of introducing cricket into Belgium; I shall
certainly try to be present at the opening game.&nbsp; I am
afraid that, until he learns from experience, the Belgian fielder
will stop cricket balls with his head.&nbsp; That the head is the
proper thing with which to play ball appears to be in his
blood.&nbsp; My head is round, he argues, and hard, just like the
ball itself; what part of the human frame more fit and proper
with which to meet and stop a ball.</p>
<p>Golf has not yet caught on, but tennis is firmly established
from St. Petersburg to Bordeaux.&nbsp; The German, with the
thoroughness characteristic of him, is working hard.&nbsp;
University professors, stout majors, rising early in the morning,
hire boys and practise back-handers and half-volleys.&nbsp; But
to the Frenchman, as yet, it is a game.&nbsp; He plays it in a
happy, merry fashion, that is shocking to English eyes.</p>
<p>Your partner&rsquo;s service rather astonishes you.&nbsp; An
occasional yard or so beyond the line happens to anyone, but this
man&rsquo;s object appears to be to break windows.&nbsp; You feel
you really must remonstrate, when the joyous laughter and
tumultuous applause of the spectators explain the puzzle to
you.&nbsp; He has not been trying to serve; he has been trying to
hit a man in the next court who is stooping down to tie up his
shoe-lace.&nbsp; With his last ball he has succeeded.&nbsp; He
has hit the man in the small of the back, and has bowled him
over.&nbsp; The unanimous opinion of the surrounding critics is
that the ball could not possibly have been better placed.&nbsp; A
Doherty has never won greater applause from the crowd.&nbsp; Even
the man who has been hit appears pleased; it shows what a
Frenchman can do when he does take up a game.</p>
<p>But French honour demands revenge.&nbsp; He forgets his shoe,
he forgets his game.&nbsp; He gathers together all the balls that
he can find; his balls, your balls, anybody&rsquo;s balls that
happen to be handy.&nbsp; And then commences the return
match.&nbsp; At this point it is best to crouch down under
shelter of the net.&nbsp; Most of the players round about adopt
this plan; the more timid make for the club-house, and, finding
themselves there, order coffee and light up cigarettes.&nbsp;
After a while both players appear to be satisfied.&nbsp; The
other players then gather round to claim their balls.&nbsp; This
makes a good game by itself.&nbsp; The object is to get as many
balls as you can, your own and other people&rsquo;s&mdash;for
preference other people&rsquo;s&mdash;and run off with them round
the courts, followed by whooping claimants.</p>
<p>In the course of half-an-hour or so, when everybody is dead
beat, the game&mdash;the original game&mdash;is resumed.&nbsp;
You demand the score; your partner promptly says it is
&ldquo;forty-fifteen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both your opponents rush up to
the net, and apparently there is going to be a duel.&nbsp; It is
only a friendly altercation; they very much doubt its being
&ldquo;forty-fifteen.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifteen-forty&rdquo;
they could believe; they suggest it as a compromise.&nbsp; The
discussion is concluded by calling it deuce.&nbsp; As it is rare
for a game to proceed without some such incident occurring in the
middle of it, the score generally is deuce.&nbsp; This avoids
heart-burning; nobody wins a set and nobody loses.&nbsp; The one
game generally suffices for the afternoon.</p>
<p>To the earnest player, it is also confusing to miss your
partner occasionally&mdash;to turn round and find that he is
talking to a man.&nbsp; Nobody but yourself takes the slightest
objection to his absence.&nbsp; The other side appear to regard
it as a good opportunity to score.&nbsp; Five minutes later he
resumes the game.&nbsp; His friend comes with him, also the dog
of his friend.&nbsp; The dog is welcomed with enthusiasm; all
balls are returned to the dog.&nbsp; Until the dog is tired you
do not get a look in.&nbsp; But all this will no doubt soon be
changed.&nbsp; There are some excellent French and Belgian
players; from them their compatriots will gradually learn higher
ideals.&nbsp; The Frenchman is young in the game.&nbsp; As the
right conception of the game grows upon him, he will also learn
to keep the balls lower.</p>
<p>I suppose it is the continental sky.&nbsp; It is so blue, so
beautiful; it naturally attracts one.&nbsp; Anyhow, the fact
remains that most tennis players on the Continent, whether
English or foreign, have a tendency to aim the ball direct at
Heaven.&nbsp; At an English club in Switzerland there existed in
my days a young Englishman who was really a wonderful
player.&nbsp; To get the ball past him was almost an
impossibility.&nbsp; It was his return that was weak.&nbsp; He
only had one stroke; the ball went a hundred feet or so into the
air and descended in his opponent&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; The other
man would stand watching it, a little speck in the Heavens,
growing gradually bigger and bigger as it neared the earth.&nbsp;
Newcomers would chatter to him, thinking he had detected a
balloon or an eagle.&nbsp; He would wave them aside, explain to
them that he would talk to them later, after the arrival of the
ball.&nbsp; It would fall with a thud at his feet, rise another
twenty yards or so and again descend.&nbsp; When it was at the
proper height he would hit it back over the net, and the next
moment it would be mounting the sky again.&nbsp; At tournaments I
have seen that young man, with tears in his eyes, pleading to be
given an umpire.&nbsp; Every umpire had fled.&nbsp; They hid
behind trees, borrowed silk hats and umbrellas and pretended they
were visitors&mdash;any device, however mean, to avoid the task
of umpiring for that young man.&nbsp; Provided his opponent did
not go to sleep or get cramp, one game might last all day.&nbsp;
Anyone could return his balls; but, as I have said, to get a ball
past him was almost an impossibility.&nbsp; He invariably won;
the other man, after an hour or so, would get mad and try to
lose.&nbsp; It was his only chance of dinner.</p>
<p>It is a pretty sight, generally speaking, a tennis ground
abroad.&nbsp; The women pay more attention to their costumes than
do our lady players.&nbsp; The men are usually in spotless
white.&nbsp; The ground is often charmingly situated, the
club-house picturesque; there is always laughter and
merriment.&nbsp; The play may not be so good to watch, but the
picture is delightful.&nbsp; I accompanied a man a little while
ago to his club on the outskirts of Brussels.&nbsp; The ground
was bordered by a wood on one side, and surrounded on the other
three by <i>petites fermes</i>&mdash;allotments, as we should
call them in England, worked by the peasants themselves.</p>
<p>It was a glorious spring afternoon.&nbsp; The courts were
crowded.&nbsp; The red earth and the green grass formed a
background against which the women, in their new Parisian
toilets, under their bright parasols, stood out like wondrous
bouquets of moving flowers.&nbsp; The whole atmosphere was a
delightful mingling of idle gaiety, flirtation, and graceful
sensuousness.&nbsp; A modern Watteau would have seized upon the
scene with avidity.</p>
<p>Just beyond&mdash;separated by the almost invisible wire
fencing&mdash;a group of peasants were working in the
field.&nbsp; An old woman and a young girl, with ropes about
their shoulders, were drawing a harrow, guided by a withered old
scarecrow of a man.&nbsp; They paused for a moment at the wire
fencing, and looked through.&nbsp; It was an odd contrast; the
two worlds divided by that wire fencing&mdash;so slight, almost
invisible.&nbsp; The girl swept the sweat from her face with her
hand; the woman pushed back her grey locks underneath the
handkerchief knotted about her head; the old man straightened
himself with some difficulty.&nbsp; So they stood, for perhaps a
minute, gazing with quiet, passionless faces through that slight
fencing, that a push from their work-hardened hands might have
levelled.</p>
<p>Was there any thought, I wonder, passing through their
brains?&nbsp; The young girl&mdash;she was a handsome creature in
spite of her disfiguring garments.&nbsp; The woman&mdash;it was a
wonderfully fine face: clear, calm eyes, deep-set under a square
broad brow.&nbsp; The withered old scarecrow&mdash;ever sowing
the seed in the spring of the fruit that others shall eat.</p>
<p>The old man bent again over the guiding ropes: gave the
word.&nbsp; The team moved forward up the hill.&nbsp; It is
Anatole France, I think, who says: Society is based upon the
patience of the poor.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>ARE
EARLY MARRIAGES A MISTAKE?</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> chary nowadays of offering
counsel in connection with subjects concerning which I am not and
cannot be an authority.&nbsp; Long ago I once took upon myself to
write a paper about babies.&nbsp; It did not aim to be a textbook
on the subject.&nbsp; It did not even claim to exhaust the
topic.&nbsp; I was willing that others, coming after me, should
continue the argument&mdash;that is if, upon reflection, they
were still of opinion there was anything more to be said.&nbsp; I
was pleased with the article.&nbsp; I went out of my way to
obtain an early copy of the magazine in which it appeared, on
purpose to show it to a lady friend of mine.&nbsp; She was the
possessor of one or two babies of her own, specimens in no way
remarkable, though she herself, as was natural enough, did her
best to boom them.&nbsp; I thought it might be helpful to her:
the views and observations, not of a rival fancier, who would be
prejudiced, but of an intelligent amateur.&nbsp; I put the
magazine into her hands, opened at the proper place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it through carefully and quietly,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t let anything distract you.&nbsp; Have a pencil
and a bit of paper ready at your side, and note down any points
upon which you would like further information.&nbsp; If there is
anything you think I have missed out let me know.&nbsp; It may be
that here and there you will be disagreeing with me.&nbsp; If so,
do not hesitate to mention it, I shall not be angry.&nbsp; If a
demand arises I shall very likely issue an enlarged and improved
edition of this paper in the form of a pamphlet, in which case
hints and suggestions that to you may appear almost impertinent
will be of distinct help to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a pencil,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about babies,&rdquo; I explained, and I lent
her a pencil.</p>
<p>That is another thing I have learnt.&nbsp; Never lend a pencil
to a woman if you ever want to see it again.&nbsp; She has three
answers to your request for its return.&nbsp; The first, that she
gave it back to you and that you put it in your pocket, and that
it&rsquo;s there now, and that if it isn&rsquo;t it ought to
be.&nbsp; The second, that you never lent it to her.&nbsp; The
third, that she wishes people would not lend her pencils and then
clamour for them back, just when she has something else far more
important to think about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about babies?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will read the paper,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;you will see for yourself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flicked over the pages contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem much of it?&rdquo; she
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is condensed,&rdquo; I pointed out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad it is short.&nbsp; All right, I&rsquo;ll read
it,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>I thought my presence might disturb her, so went out into the
garden.&nbsp; I wanted her to get the full benefit of it.&nbsp; I
crept back now and again to peep through the open window.&nbsp;
She did not seem to be making many notes.&nbsp; But I heard her
making little noises to herself.&nbsp; When I saw she had reached
the last page, I re-entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it meant to be funny,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;or
is it intended to be taken seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be flashes of humour here and
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not wait for me to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if it&rsquo;s meant to be funny,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is at all funny.&nbsp; And if
it is intended to be serious, there&rsquo;s one thing very clear,
and that is that you are not a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the unerring instinct of the born critic she had divined
my one weak point.&nbsp; Other objections raised against me I
could have met.&nbsp; But that one stinging reproach was
unanswerable.&nbsp; It has made me, as I have explained, chary of
tendering advice on matters outside my own department of
life.&nbsp; Otherwise, every year, about Valentine&rsquo;s day,
there is much that I should like to say to my good friends the
birds.&nbsp; I want to put it to them seriously.&nbsp; Is not the
month of February just a little too early?&nbsp; Of course, their
answer would be the same as in the case of my motherly
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what do you know about it? you are not a
bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know I am not a bird, but that is the very reason why they
should listen to me.&nbsp; I bring a fresh mind to bear upon the
subject.&nbsp; I am not tied down by bird convention.&nbsp;
February, my dear friends&mdash;in these northern climes of ours
at all events&mdash;is much too early.&nbsp; You have to build in
a high wind, and nothing, believe me, tries a lady&rsquo;s temper
more than being blown about.&nbsp; Nature is nature, and
womenfolk, my dear sirs, are the same all the world over, whether
they be birds or whether they be human.&nbsp; I am an older
person than most of you, and I speak with the weight of
experience.</p>
<p>If I were going to build a house with my wife, I should not
choose a season of the year when the bricks and planks and things
were liable to be torn out of her hand, her skirts blown over her
head, and she left clinging for dear life to a scaffolding
pole.&nbsp; I know the feminine biped and, you take it from me,
that is not her notion of a honeymoon.&nbsp; In April or May, the
sun shining, the air balmy&mdash;when, after carrying up to her a
load or two of bricks, and a hod or two of mortar, we could knock
off work for a few minutes without fear of the whole house being
swept away into the next street&mdash;could sit side by side on
the top of a wall, our legs dangling down, and peck and morsel
together; after which I could whistle a bit to her&mdash;then
housebuilding might be a pleasure.</p>
<p>The swallows are wisest; June is their idea, and a very good
idea, too.&nbsp; In a mountain village in the Tyrol, early one
summer, I had the opportunity of watching very closely the
building of a swallow&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; After coffee, the first
morning, I stepped out from the great, cool, dark passage of the
wirtschaft into the blazing sunlight, and, for no particular
reason, pulled-to the massive door behind me.&nbsp; While filling
my pipe, a swallow almost brushed by me, then wheeled round
again, and took up a position on the fence only a few yards from
me.&nbsp; He was carrying what to him was an exceptionally large
and heavy brick.&nbsp; He put it down beside him on the fence,
and called out something which I could not understand.&nbsp; I
did not move.&nbsp; He got quite excited and said some
more.&nbsp; It was undoubtable he was addressing me&mdash;nobody
else was by.&nbsp; I judged from his tone that he was getting
cross with me.&nbsp; At this point my travelling companion, his
toilet unfinished, put his head out of the window just above
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an odd thing,&rdquo; he called down to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never noticed it last night.&nbsp; A pair of swallows
are building a nest here in the hall.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to
be careful you don&rsquo;t mistake it for a hat-peg.&nbsp; The
old lady says they have built there regularly for the last three
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it came to me what it was the gentleman had been saying
to me: &ldquo;I say, sir, you with the bit of wood in your mouth,
you have been and shut the door and I can&rsquo;t get
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, with the key in my possession, it was so clear and
understandable, I really forgot for the moment he was only a
bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I had no
idea.&nbsp; Such an extraordinary place to build a
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened the door for him, and, taking up his brick again, he
entered, and I followed him in.&nbsp; There was a deal of
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shut the door,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;Chap
there, sucking the bit of wood.&nbsp; Thought I was never going
to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;it has been so
dark in here, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, I&rsquo;ve hardly been
able to see what I&rsquo;ve been doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine brick, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Where will you have
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing me sitting there, they lowered their voices.&nbsp;
Evidently she wanted him to put the brick down and leave her to
think.&nbsp; She was not quite sure where she would have
it.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, was sure he had found the right
place for it.&nbsp; He pointed it out to her and explained his
views.&nbsp; Other birds quarrel a good deal during nest
building, but swallows are the gentlest of little people.&nbsp;
She let him put it where he wanted to, and he kissed her and ran
out.&nbsp; She cocked her eye after him, watched till he was out
of sight, then deftly and quickly slipped it out and fixed it the
other side of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dears&rdquo; (I could see it in the toss of her
head); &ldquo;they will think they know best; it is just as well
not to argue with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every summer I suffer much from indignation.&nbsp; I love to
watch the swallows building.&nbsp; They build beneath the eaves
outside my study window.&nbsp; Such cheerful little chatter-boxes
they are.&nbsp; Long after sunset, when all the other birds are
sleeping, the swallows still are chattering softly.&nbsp; It
sounds as if they were telling one another some pretty story, and
often I am sure there must be humour in it, for every now and
then one hears a little twittering laugh.&nbsp; I delight in
having them there, so close to me.&nbsp; The fancy comes to me
that one day, when my brain has grown more cunning, I, too,
listening in the twilight, shall hear the stories that they
tell.</p>
<p>One or two phrases already I have come to understand:
&ldquo;Once upon a time&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Long, long
ago&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In a strange, far-off land.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I hear these words so constantly, I am sure I have them
right.&nbsp; I call it &ldquo;Swallow Street,&rdquo; this row of
six or seven nests.&nbsp; Two or three, like villas in their own
grounds, stand alone, and others are semi-detached.&nbsp; It
makes me angry that the sparrows will come and steal them.&nbsp;
The sparrows will hang about deliberately waiting for a pair of
swallows to finish their nest, and then, with a brutal laugh that
makes my blood boil, drive the swallows away and take possession
of it.&nbsp; And the swallows are so wonderfully patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, old girl,&rdquo; says Tommy Swallow, after
the first big cry is over, to Jenny Swallow, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And half an hour later, full of fresh plans, they are choosing
another likely site, chattering cheerfully once more.&nbsp; I
watched the building of a particular nest for nearly a fortnight
one year; and when, after two or three days&rsquo; absence, I
returned and found a pair of sparrows comfortably encsonced
therein, I just felt mad.&nbsp; I saw Mrs. Sparrow looking
out.&nbsp; Maybe my anger was working upon my imagination, but it
seemed to me that she nodded to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little house, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; What I call
well built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sparrow then flew up with a gaudy feather, dyed blue,
which belonged to me.&nbsp; I recognised it.&nbsp; It had come
out of the brush with which the girl breaks the china ornaments
in our drawing-room.&nbsp; At any other time I should have been
glad to see him flying off with the whole thing, handle
included.&nbsp; But now I felt the theft of that one feather as
an added injury.&nbsp; Mrs. Sparrow chirped with delight at sight
of the gaudy monstrosity.&nbsp; Having got the house cheap, they
were going to spend their small amount of energy upon internal
decoration.&nbsp; That was their idea clearly, a &ldquo;Liberty
interior.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked more like a Cockney sparrow
than a country one&mdash;had been born and bred in Regent Street,
no doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much justice in this world,&rdquo; said I
to myself; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s going to be some introduced
into this business&mdash;that is, if I can find a
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did find a ladder, and fortunately it was long enough.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were out when I arrived, possibly on the
hunt for cheap photo frames and Japanese fans.&nbsp; I did not
want to make a mess.&nbsp; I removed the house neatly into a
dust-pan, and wiped the street clear of every trace of it.&nbsp;
I had just put back the ladder when Mrs. Sparrow returned with a
piece of pink cotton-wool in her mouth.&nbsp; That was her idea
of a colour scheme: apple-blossom pink and Reckitt&rsquo;s blue
side by side.&nbsp; She dropped her wool and sat on the
waterspout, and tried to understand things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number one, number two, number four; where the
blazes&rdquo;&mdash;sparrows are essentially common, and the
women are as bad as the men&mdash;&ldquo;is number
three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sparrow came up from behind, over the roof.&nbsp; He was
carrying a piece of yellow-fluff, part of a lamp-shade, as far as
I could judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move yourself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
sense of sitting there in the rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out just for a moment,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Sparrow; &ldquo;I could not have been gone, no, not a couple of
minutes.&nbsp; When I came back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, get indoors,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow, &ldquo;talk
about it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m telling you,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Sparrow, &ldquo;if you would only listen.&nbsp; There
isn&rsquo;t any door, there isn&rsquo;t any
house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t any&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Sparrow, holding on
to the rim of the spout, turned himself topsy-turvy and surveyed
the street.&nbsp; From where I was standing behind the laurel
bushes I could see nothing but his back.</p>
<p>He stood up again, looking angry and flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with the house?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I
turn my back a minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nothing with it.&nbsp; As I keep on
telling you, I had only just gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother where you had gone.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the
darned house gone? that&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another.&nbsp; If ever astonishment was
expressed in the attitude of a bird it was told by the tails of
those two sparrows.&nbsp; They whispered wickedly together.&nbsp;
The idea occurred to them that by force or cunning they might
perhaps obtain possession of one of the other nests.&nbsp; But
all the other nests were occupied, and even gentle Jenny Swallow,
once in her own home with the children round about her, is not to
be trifled with.&nbsp; Mr. Sparrow called at number two, put his
head in at the door, and then returned to the waterspout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady says we don&rsquo;t live there,&rdquo; he
explained to Mrs. Sparrow.&nbsp; There was silence for a
while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what I call a classy street,&rdquo; commented Mrs.
Sparrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were not for that terrible tired feeling of
mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow, &ldquo;blame if I wouldn&rsquo;t
build a house of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sparrow, &ldquo;&mdash;I have
heard it said that a little bit of work, now and then, does you
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All sorts of wild ideas about in the air
nowadays,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t do to
listen to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it don&rsquo;t do to sit still and do nothing
neither,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Sparrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to have to forget I&rsquo;m a lady, but&mdash;well, any man
who was a man would see things for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I every marry?&rdquo; retorted Mr. Sparrow.</p>
<p>They flew away together, quarrelling.</p>
<h2><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>DO
WRITERS WRITE TOO MUCH?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a newspaper placard, the other
day, I saw announced a new novel by a celebrated author.&nbsp; I
bought a copy of the paper, and turned eagerly to the last
page.&nbsp; I was disappointed to find that I had missed the
first six chapters.&nbsp; The story had commenced the previous
Saturday; this was Friday.&nbsp; I say I was disappointed and so
I was, at first.&nbsp; But my disappointment did not last
long.&nbsp; The bright and intelligent sub-editor, according to
the custom now in vogue, had provided me with a short synopsis of
those first six chapters, so that without the trouble of reading
them I knew what they were all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first instalment,&rdquo; I learned,
&ldquo;introduces the reader to a brilliant and distinguished
company, assembled in the drawing-room of Lady Mary&rsquo;s
maisonette in Park Street.&nbsp; Much smart talk is indulged
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that &ldquo;smart talk&rdquo; so well.&nbsp; Had I not
been lucky enough to miss that first chapter I should have had to
listen to it once again.&nbsp; Possibly, here and there, it might
have been new to me, but it would have read, I know, so very like
the old.&nbsp; A dear, sweet white-haired lady of my acquaintance
is never surprised at anything that happens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something very much of the same kind occurred,&rdquo;
she will remember, &ldquo;one winter when we were staying in
Brighton.&nbsp; Only on that occasion the man&rsquo;s name, I
think, was Robinson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not live new stories&mdash;nor write them either.&nbsp;
The man&rsquo;s name in the old story was Robinson, we alter it
to Jones.&nbsp; It happened, in the old forgotten tale, at
Brighton, in the winter time; we change it to Eastbourne, in the
spring.&nbsp; It is new and original&mdash;to those who have not
heard &ldquo;something very like it&rdquo; once before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much smart talk is indulged in,&rdquo; so the
sub-editor has explained.&nbsp; There is absolutely no need to
ask for more than that.&nbsp; There is a Duchess who says
improper things.&nbsp; Once she used to shock me.&nbsp; But I
know her now.&nbsp; She is really a nice woman; she doesn&rsquo;t
mean them.&nbsp; And when the heroine is in trouble, towards the
middle of the book, she is just as amusing on the side of
virtue.&nbsp; Then there is a younger lady whose speciality is
proverbs.&nbsp; Apparently whenever she hears a proverb she
writes it down and studies it with the idea of seeing into how
many different forms it can be twisted.&nbsp; It looks clever; as
a matter of fact, it is extremely easy.</p>
<p><i>Be virtuous and you will be happy</i>.</p>
<p>She jots down all the possible variations: <i>Be virtuous and
you will be unhappy</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too simple that one,&rdquo; she tells herself.&nbsp;
<i>Be virtuous and your friends will be happy if you are
not</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, but not wicked enough.&nbsp; Let us think
again.&nbsp; <i>Be happy and people will jump to the conclusion
that you are virtuous</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;ll try that one at
to-morrow&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is a painstaking lady.&nbsp; One feels that, better
advised, she might have been of use in the world.</p>
<p>There is likewise a disgraceful old Peer who tells naughty
stories, but who is good at heart; and one person so very rude
that the wonder is who invited him.</p>
<p>Occasionally a slangy girl is included, and a clergyman, who
takes the heroine aside and talks sense to her, flavoured with
epigram.&nbsp; All these people chatter a mixture of Lord
Chesterfield and Oliver Wendell Holmes, of Heine, Voltaire,
Madame de Stael, and the late lamented H. J. Byron.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How they do it beats me,&rdquo; as I once overheard at a
music hall a stout lady confess to her friend while witnessing
the performance of a clever troup, styling themselves &ldquo;The
Boneless Wonders of the Universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The synopsis added that: &ldquo;Ursula Bart, a charming and
unsophisticated young American girl possessed of an elusive
expression makes her first acquaintance with London
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here you have a week&rsquo;s unnecessary work on the part of
the author boiled down to its essentials.&nbsp; She was
young.&nbsp; One hardly expects an elderly heroine.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;young&rdquo; might have been dispensed with, especially
seeing it is told us that she was a girl.&nbsp; But maybe this is
carping.&nbsp; There are young girls and old girls.&nbsp; Perhaps
it is as well to have it in black and white; she was young.&nbsp;
She was an American young girl.&nbsp; There is but one American
young girl in English fiction.&nbsp; We know by heart the
unconventional things that she will do, the startlingly original
things that she will say, the fresh illuminating thoughts that
will come to her as, clad in a loose robe of some soft clinging
stuff, she sits before the fire, in the solitude of her own
room.</p>
<p>To complete her she had an &ldquo;elusive
expression.&rdquo;&nbsp; The days when we used to catalogue the
heroine&rsquo;s &ldquo;points&rdquo; are past.&nbsp; Formerly it
was possible.&nbsp; A man wrote perhaps some half-a-dozen novels
during the whole course of his career.&nbsp; He could have a dark
girl for the first, a light girl for the second, sketch a merry
little wench for the third, and draw you something stately for
the fourth.&nbsp; For the remaining two he could go abroad.&nbsp;
Nowadays, when a man turns out a novel and six short stories once
a year, description has to be dispensed with.&nbsp; It is not the
writer&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; There is not sufficient variety in
the sex.&nbsp; We used to introduce her thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine to yourself, dear reader, an exquisite and
gracious creature of five feet three.&nbsp; Her golden hair of
that peculiar shade&rdquo;&mdash;here would follow directions
enabling the reader to work it out for himself.&nbsp; He was to
pour some particular wine into some particular sort of glass, and
wave it about before some particular sort of a light.&nbsp; Or he
was to get up at five o&rsquo;clock on a March morning and go
into a wood.&nbsp; In this way he could satisfy himself as to the
particular shade of gold the heroine&rsquo;s hair might happen to
be.&nbsp; If he were a careless or lazy reader he could save
himself time and trouble by taking the author&rsquo;s word for
it.&nbsp; Many of them did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her eyes!&rdquo;&nbsp; They were invariably deep and
liquid.&nbsp; They had to be pretty deep to hold all the odds and
ends that were hidden in them; sunlight and shadow, mischief,
unsuspected possibilities, assorted emotions, strange wild
yearnings.&nbsp; Anything we didn&rsquo;t know where else to put
we said was hidden in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her nose!&rdquo;&nbsp; You could have made it for
yourself out of a pen&rsquo;orth of putty after reading our
description of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her forehead!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was always &ldquo;low and
broad.&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why it was always
low.&nbsp; Maybe because the intellectual heroine was not then
popular.&nbsp; For the matter of that I doubt if she be really
popular now.&nbsp; The brainless doll, one fears, will continue
for many years to come to be man&rsquo;s ideal woman&mdash;and
woman&rsquo;s ideal of herself for precisely the same period, one
may be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her chin!&rdquo;&nbsp; A less degree of variety was
permissible in her chin.&nbsp; It had to be at an angle
suggestive of piquancy, and it had to contain at least the
suspicion of a dimple.</p>
<p>To properly understand her complexion you were expected to
provide yourself with a collection of assorted fruits and
flowers.&nbsp; There are seasons in the year when it must have
been difficult for the conscientious reader to have made sure of
her complexion.&nbsp; Possibly it was for this purpose that wax
flowers and fruit, carefully kept from the dust under glass
cases, were common objects in former times upon the tables of the
cultured.</p>
<p>Nowadays we content ourselves&mdash;and our readers also, I am
inclined to think&mdash;with dashing her off in a few bold
strokes.&nbsp; We say that whenever she entered a room there came
to one dreams of an old world garden, the sound of far-off
bells.&nbsp; Or that her presence brought with it the scent of
hollyhocks and thyme.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I don&rsquo;t
think hollyhocks do smell.&nbsp; It is a small point; about such
we do not trouble ourselves.&nbsp; In the case of the homely type
of girl I don&rsquo;t see why we should not borrow Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s expression, and define her by saying that in
some subtle way she always contrived to suggest an odour of chops
and tomato sauce.</p>
<p>If we desire to be exact we mention, as this particular author
seems to have done, that she had an &ldquo;elusive
expression,&rdquo; or a penetrating fragrance.&nbsp; Or we say
that she moved, the centre of an indefinable nuance.</p>
<p>But it is not policy to bind oneself too closely to
detail.&nbsp; A wise friend of mine, who knows his business,
describes his hero invariably in the vaguest terms.&nbsp; He will
not even tell you whether the man is tall or short, clean shaven
or bearded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the fellow nice,&rdquo; is his advice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let every woman reader picture him to herself as her
particular man.&nbsp; Then everything he says and does becomes of
importance to her.&nbsp; She is careful not to miss a
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the same reason he sees to it that his heroine has a bit
of every girl in her.&nbsp; Generally speaking, she is a cross
between Romola and Dora Copperfield.&nbsp; His novels command
enormous sales.&nbsp; The women say he draws a man to the life,
but does not seem to know much about women.&nbsp; The men like
his women, but think his men stupid.</p>
<p>Of another famous author no woman of my acquaintance is able
to speak too highly.&nbsp; They tell me his knowledge of their
sex is simply marvellous, his insight, his understanding of them
almost uncanny.&nbsp; Thinking it might prove useful, I made an
exhaustive study of his books.&nbsp; I noticed that his women
were without exception brilliant charming creatures possessed of
the wit of a Lady Wortlay Montagu, combined with the wisdom of a
George Eliot.&nbsp; They were not all of them good women, but all
of them were clever and all of them were fascinating.&nbsp; I
came to the conclusion that his lady critics were correct: he did
understand women.&nbsp; But to return to our synopsis.</p>
<p>The second chapter, it appeared, transported us to Yorkshire
where: &ldquo;Basil Longleat, a typical young Englishman, lately
home from college, resides with his widowed mother and two
sisters.&nbsp; They are a delightful family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a world of trouble to both writer and to reader is here
saved.&nbsp; &ldquo;A typical young Englishman!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
author probably wrote five pages, elaborating.&nbsp; The five
words of the sub-editor present him to me more vividly.&nbsp; I
see him positively glistening from the effects of soap and
water.&nbsp; I see his clear blue eye; his fair crisp locks, the
natural curliness of which annoys him personally, though alluring
to everybody else; his frank winning smile.&nbsp; He is
&ldquo;lately home from college.&rdquo;&nbsp; That tells me that
he is a first-class cricketer; a first-class oar; that as a
half-back he is incomparable; that he swims like Captain Webb; is
in the first rank of tennis players; that his half-volley at
ping-pong has never been stopped.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t tell me
much about his brain power.&nbsp; The description of him as a
&ldquo;typical young Englishman&rdquo; suggests more information
on this particular point.&nbsp; One assumes that the American
girl with the elusive expression is going to have sufficient for
both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a delightful family.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
sub-editor does not say so, but I imagine the two sisters are
likewise typical young Englishwomen.&nbsp; They ride and shoot
and cook and make their own dresses, have common sense and love a
joke.</p>
<p>The third chapter is &ldquo;taken up with the humours of a
local cricket match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Sub-editor.&nbsp; I feel I owe you
gratitude.</p>
<p>In the fourth, Ursula Bart (I was beginning to get anxious
about her) turns up again.&nbsp; She is staying at the useful
Lady Mary&rsquo;s place in Yorkshire.&nbsp; She meets Basil by
accident one morning while riding alone.&nbsp; That is the
advantage of having an American girl for your heroine.&nbsp; Like
the British army: it goes anywhere and does anything.</p>
<p>In chapter five Basil and Ursula meet again; this time at a
picnic.&nbsp; The sub-editor does not wish to repeat himself,
otherwise he possibly would have summed up chapter five by saying
it was &ldquo;taken up with the humours of the usual
picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In chapter six something happens:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basil, returning home in the twilight, comes across
Ursula Bart, in a lonely point of the moor, talking earnestly to
a rough-looking stranger.&nbsp; His approach over the soft turf
being unnoticed, he cannot help overhearing Ursula&rsquo;s
parting words to the forbidding-looking stranger: &lsquo;I must
see you again!&nbsp; To-morrow night at half-past nine!&nbsp; In
the gateway of the ruined abbey!&rsquo;&nbsp; Who is he?&nbsp;
And why must Ursula see him again at such an hour, in such a
spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here, at cost of reading twenty lines, I am landed, so to
speak, at the beginning of the seventh chapter.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t I set to work to read it?&nbsp; The sub-editor has
spoiled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read it,&rdquo; I want to say to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me to-morrow morning what it is all about.&nbsp; Who
was this bounder?&nbsp; Why should Ursula want to see him
again?&nbsp; Why choose a draughty place?&nbsp; Why half-past
nine o&rsquo;clock at night, which must have been an awkward time
for both of them&mdash;likely to lead to talk?&nbsp; Why should I
wade though this seventh chapter of three columns and a
half?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your work.&nbsp; What are you paid
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My fear is lest this sort of thing shall lead to a demand on
the part of the public for condensed novels.&nbsp; What busy man
is going to spend a week of evenings reading a book when a nice
kind sub-editor is prepared in five minutes to tell him what it
is all about!</p>
<p>Then there will come a day&mdash;I feel it&mdash;when the
business-like Editor will say to himself: &ldquo;What in thunder
is the sense of my paying one man to write a story of sixty
thousand words and another man to read it and tell it again in
sixteen hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shall be expected to write our novels in chapters not
exceeding twenty words.&nbsp; Our short stories will be reduced
to the formula: &ldquo;Little boy.&nbsp; Pair of skates.&nbsp;
Broken ice, Heaven&rsquo;s gates.&rdquo;&nbsp; Formerly an
author, commissioned to supply a child&rsquo;s tragedy of this
genre for a Christmas number, would have spun it out into five
thousand words.&nbsp; Personally, I should have commenced the
previous spring&mdash;given the reader the summer and autumn to
get accustomed to the boy.&nbsp; He would have been a good boy;
the sort of boy that makes a bee-line for the thinnest ice.&nbsp;
He would have lived in a cottage.&nbsp; I could have spread that
cottage over two pages; the things that grew in the garden, the
view from the front door.&nbsp; You would have known that boy
before I had done with him&mdash;felt you had known him all your
life.&nbsp; His quaint sayings, his childish thoughts, his great
longings would have been impressed upon you.&nbsp; The father
might have had a dash of humour in him, the mother&rsquo;s early
girlhood would have lent itself to pretty writing.&nbsp; For the
ice we would have had a mysterious lake in the wood, said to be
haunted.&nbsp; The boy would have loved o&rsquo; twilights to
stand upon its margin.&nbsp; He would have heard strange voices
calling to him.&nbsp; You would have felt the thing was
coming.</p>
<p>So much might have been done.&nbsp; When I think of that plot
wasted in nine words it makes me positively angry.</p>
<p>And what is to become of us writers if this is to be the new
fashion in literature?&nbsp; We are paid by the length of our
manuscript at rates from half-a-crown a thousand words, and
upwards.&nbsp; In the case of fellows like Doyle and Kipling I am
told it runs into pounds.&nbsp; How are we to live on novels the
serial rights of which to most of us will work out at four and
nine-pence.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp; It is no good telling me you can
see no reason why we should live.&nbsp; That is no answer.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m talking plain business.</p>
<p>And what about book-rights?&nbsp; Who is going to buy novels
of three pages?&nbsp; They will have to be printed as leaflets
and sold at a penny a dozen.&nbsp; Marie Corelli and Hall
Caine&mdash;if all I hear about them is true&mdash;will possibly
make their ten or twelve shillings a week.&nbsp; But what about
the rest of us?&nbsp; This thing is worrying me.</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>SHOULD SOLDIERS BE POLITE?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> desire was once to pass a
peaceful and pleasant winter in Brussels, attending to my work,
improving my mind.&nbsp; Brussels is a bright and cheerful town,
and I think I could have succeeded had it not been for the
Belgian Army.&nbsp; The Belgian Army would follow me about and
worry me.&nbsp; Judging of it from my own experience, I should
say it was a good army.&nbsp; Napoleon laid it down as an axiom
that your enemy never ought to be permitted to get away from
you&mdash;never ought to be allowed to feel, even for a moment,
that he had shaken you off.&nbsp; What tactics the Belgian Army
might adopt under other conditions I am unable to say, but
against me personally that was the plan of campaign it determined
upon and carried out with a success that was astonishing, even to
myself.</p>
<p>I found it utterly impossible to escape from the Belgian
Army.&nbsp; I made a point of choosing the quietest and most
unlikely streets, I chose all hours&mdash;early in the morning,
in the afternoon, late in the evening.&nbsp; There were moments
of wild exaltation when I imagined I had given it the slip.&nbsp;
I could not see it anywhere, I could not hear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;now for five
minutes&rsquo; peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been doing it injustice: it had been working round
me.&nbsp; Approaching the next corner, I would hear the tattoo of
its drum.&nbsp; Before I had gone another quarter of a mile it
would be in full pursuit of me.&nbsp; I would jump upon a tram,
and travel for miles.&nbsp; Then, thinking I had shaken it off, I
would alight and proceed upon my walk.&nbsp; Five minutes later
another detachment would be upon my heels.&nbsp; I would slink
home, the Belgian Army pursuing me with its exultant
tattoo.&nbsp; Vanquished, shamed, my insular pride for ever
vanished, I would creep up into my room and close the door.&nbsp;
The victorious Belgian Army would then march back to
barracks.</p>
<p>If only it had followed me with a band: I like a band.&nbsp; I
can loaf against a post, listening to a band with anyone.&nbsp; I
should not have minded so much had it come after me with a
band.&nbsp; But the Belgian Army, apparently, doesn&rsquo;t run
to a band.&nbsp; It has nothing but this drum.&nbsp; It has not
even a real drum&mdash;not what I call a drum.&nbsp; It is a
little boy&rsquo;s drum, the sort of thing I used to play myself
at one time, until people took it away from me, and threatened
that if they heard it once again that day they would break it
over my own head.&nbsp; It is cowardly going up and down, playing
a drum of this sort, when there is nobody to stop you.&nbsp; The
man would not dare to do it if his mother was about.&nbsp; He
does not even play it.&nbsp; He walks along tapping it with a
little stick.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no tune, there&rsquo;s no sense
in it.&nbsp; He does not even keep time.&nbsp; I used to think at
first, hearing it in the distance, that it was the work of some
young gamin who ought to be at school, or making himself useful
taking the baby out in the perambulator: and I would draw back
into dark doorways, determined, as he came by, to dart out and
pull his ear for him.&nbsp; To my astonishment&mdash;for the
first week&mdash;I learnt it was the Belgian Army, getting itself
accustomed, one supposes, to the horrors of war.&nbsp; It had the
effect of making me a peace-at-any-price man.</p>
<p>They tell me these armies are necessary to preserve the
tranquility of Europe.&nbsp; For myself, I should be willing to
run the risk of an occasional row.&nbsp; Cannot someone tell them
they are out of date, with their bits of feathers and their odds
and ends of ironmongery&mdash;grown men that cannot be sent out
for a walk unless accompanied by a couple of nursemen, blowing a
tin whistle and tapping a drum out of a toy shop to keep them in
order and prevent their running about: one might think they were
chickens.&nbsp; A herd of soldiers with their pots and pans and
parcels, and all their deadly things tied on to them, prancing
about in time to a tune, makes me think always of the White
Knight that Alice met in Wonderland.&nbsp; I take it that for
practical purposes&mdash;to fight for your country, or to fight
for somebody else&rsquo;s country, which is, generally speaking,
more popular&mdash;the thing essential is that a certain
proportion of the populace should be able to shoot straight with
a gun.&nbsp; How standing in a line and turning out your toes is
going to assist you, under modern conditions of warfare, is one
of the many things my intellect is incapable of grasping.</p>
<p>In medi&aelig;val days, when men fought hand to hand, there
must have been advantage in combined and precise movement.&nbsp;
When armies were mere iron machines, the simple endeavour of each
being to push the other off the earth, then the striking
simultaneously with a thousand arms was part of the game.&nbsp;
Now, when we shoot from behind cover with smokeless powder, brain
not brute force&mdash;individual sense not combined solidity is
surely the result to be aimed at.&nbsp; Cannot somebody, as I
have suggested, explain to the military man that the proper place
for the drill sergeant nowadays is under a glass case in some
museum of antiquities?</p>
<p>I lived once near the Hyde Park barracks, and saw much of the
drill sergeant&rsquo;s method.&nbsp; Generally speaking, he is a
stout man with the walk of an egotistical pigeon.&nbsp; His voice
is one of the most extraordinary things in nature: if you can
distinguish it from the bark of a dog, you are clever.&nbsp; They
tell me that the privates, after a little practice,
can&mdash;which gives one a higher opinion of their intelligence
than otherwise one might form.&nbsp; But myself I doubt even this
statement.&nbsp; I was the owner of a fine retriever dog about
the time of which I am speaking, and sometimes he and I would
amuse ourselves by watching Mr. Sergeant exercising his
squad.&nbsp; One morning he had been shouting out the usual
&ldquo;Whough, whough, whough!&rdquo; for about ten minutes, and
all had hitherto gone well.&nbsp; Suddenly, and evidently to his
intense astonishment, the squad turned their backs upon him and
commenced to walk towards the Serpentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; yelled the sergeant, the instant his
amazed indignation permitted him to speak, which fortunately
happened in time to save the detachment from a watery grave.</p>
<p>The squad halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the thunder, and the blazes, and other things told
you to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squad looked bewildered, but said nothing, and were
brought back to the place where they were before.&nbsp; A minute
later precisely the same thing occurred again.&nbsp; I really
thought the sergeant would burst.&nbsp; I was preparing to hasten
to the barracks for medical aid.&nbsp; But the paroxysm
passed.&nbsp; Calling upon the combined forces of heaven and hell
to sustain him in his trouble, he requested his squad, as man to
man, to inform him of the reason why to all appearance they were
dispensing with his services and drilling themselves.</p>
<p>At this moment &ldquo;Columbus&rdquo; barked again, and the
explanation came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go away, sir,&rdquo; he requested me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can I exercise my men with that dog of yours
interfering every five minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not only on that occasion.&nbsp; It happened at other
times.&nbsp; The dog seemed to understand and take a pleasure in
it.&nbsp; Sometimes meeting a soldier, walking with his
sweetheart, Columbus, from behind my legs, would bark
suddenly.&nbsp; Immediately the man would let go the girl and
proceed, involuntarily, to perform military tricks.</p>
<p>The War Office authorities accused me of having trained the
dog.&nbsp; I had not trained him: that was his natural
voice.&nbsp; I suggested to the War Office authorities that
instead of quarrelling with my dog for talking his own language,
they should train their sergeants to use English.</p>
<p>They would not see it.&nbsp; Unpleasantness was in the air,
and, living where I did at the time, I thought it best to part
with Columbus.&nbsp; I could see what the War Office was driving
at, and I did not desire that responsibility for the inefficiency
of the British Army should be laid at my door.</p>
<p>Some twenty years ago we, in London, were passing through a
riotous period, and a call was made to law-abiding citizens to
enrol themselves as special constables.&nbsp; I was young, and
the hope of trouble appealed to me more than it does now.&nbsp;
In company with some five or six hundred other more or less
respectable citizens, I found myself one Sunday morning in the
drill yard of the Albany Barracks.&nbsp; It was the opinion of
the authorities that we could guard our homes and protect our
wives and children better if first of all we learned to roll our
&ldquo;eyes right&rdquo; or left at the given word of command,
and to walk with our thumbs stuck out.&nbsp; Accordingly a drill
sergeant was appointed to instruct us on these points.&nbsp; He
came out of the canteen, wiping his mouth and flicking his leg,
according to rule, with the regulation cane.&nbsp; But, as he
approached us, his expression changed.&nbsp; We were stout,
pompous-looking gentlemen, the majority of us, in frock coats and
silk hats.&nbsp; The sergeant was a man with a sense of the
fitness of things.&nbsp; The idea of shouting and swearing at us
fell from him: and that gone there seemed to be no happy medium
left to him.&nbsp; The stiffness departed from his back.&nbsp; He
met us with a defferential attitude, and spoke to us in the
language of social intercourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; we replied: and there was a
pause.</p>
<p>The sergeant fidgetted upon his feet.&nbsp; We waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the sergeant, with a
pleasant smile, &ldquo;what do you say to falling in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We agreed to fall in.&nbsp; He showed us how to do it.&nbsp;
He cast a critical eye along the back of our rear line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little further forward, number three, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, sir,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>Number three, who was an important-looking gentleman, stepped
forward.</p>
<p>The sergeant cast his critical eye along the front of the
first line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little further back, if you don&rsquo;t mind,
sir,&rdquo; he suggested, addressing the third gentleman from the
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; explained the third gentleman,
&ldquo;much as I can do to keep where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant cast his critical eye between the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;a little
full-chested, some of us.&nbsp; We will make the distance another
foot, if you please, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In pleasant manner, like to this, the drill proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, gentlemen, shall we try a little walk?&nbsp;
Quick march!&nbsp; Thank you, gentlemen.&nbsp; Sorry to trouble
you, but it may be necessary to run&mdash;forward I mean, of
course..&nbsp; So if you really do not mind, we will now do the
double quick.&nbsp; Halt!&nbsp; And if next time you can keep a
little more in line&mdash;it has a more imposing appearance, if
you understand me.&nbsp; The breathing comes with
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the thing must be done at all, why should it not be done in
this way?&nbsp; Why should not the sergeant address the new
recruits politely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, you young chaps, are you all ready?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t hurry yourselves: no need to make hard work of what
should be a pleasure to all of us.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,
that&rsquo;s very good indeed&mdash;considering you are only
novices.&nbsp; But there is still something to be desired in your
attitude, Private Bully-boy.&nbsp; You will excuse my being
personal, but are you knock-kneed naturally?&nbsp; Or could you,
with an effort, do you think, contrive to give yourself less the
appearance of a marionette whose strings have become loose?&nbsp;
Thank you, that is better.&nbsp; These little things appear
trivial, I know, but, after all, we may as well try and look our
best&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like your boots, Private
Montmorency?&nbsp; Oh, I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I thought from
the way you were bending down and looking at them that perhaps
their appearance was dissatisfying to you.&nbsp; My mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you suffering from indigestion, my poor
fellow?&nbsp; Shall I get you a little brandy?&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t indigestion.&nbsp; Then what&rsquo;s the matter with
it?&nbsp; Why are you trying to hide it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing
to be ashamed of.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all got one.&nbsp; Let it
come forward man.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having succeeded, with a few such kindly words, in getting his
line into order, he would proceed to recommend healthy
exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoulder arms!&nbsp; Good, gentlemen, very good for a
beginning.&nbsp; Yet still, if I may be critical, not
perfect.&nbsp; There is more in this thing than you might
imagine, gentlemen.&nbsp; May I point out to Private Henry
Thompson that a musket carried across the shoulder at right
angles is apt to inconvenience the gentleman behind.&nbsp; Even
from the point of view of his own comfort, I feel sure that
Private Thompson would do better to follow the usual custom in
this matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would also suggest to Private St. Leonard that we are
not here to practice the art of balancing a heavy musket on the
outstretched palm of the hand.&nbsp; Private St. Leonard&rsquo;s
performance with the musket is decidedly clever.&nbsp; But it is
not war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, gentlemen, this thing has been carefully
worked out, and no improvement is likely to result from
individual effort.&nbsp; Let our idea be uniformity.&nbsp; It is
monotonous, but it is safe.&nbsp; Now, then, gentlemen, once
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drill yard would be converted into a source of innocent
delight to thousands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Officer and gentleman&rdquo;
would become a phrase of meaning.&nbsp; I present the idea, for
what it may be worth, with my compliments, to Pall Mall.</p>
<p>The fault of the military man is that he studies too much,
reads too much history, is over reflective.&nbsp; If, instead, he
would look about him more he would notice that things are
changing.&nbsp; Someone has told the British military man that
Waterloo was won upon the playing fields of Eton.&nbsp; So he
goes to Eton and plays.&nbsp; One of these days he will be called
upon to fight another Waterloo: and afterwards&mdash;when it is
too late&mdash;they will explain to him that it was won not upon
the play field but in the class room.</p>
<p>From the mound on the old Waterloo plain one can form a notion
of what battles, under former conditions, must have been.&nbsp;
The other battlefields of Europe are rapidly disappearing: useful
Dutch cabbages, as Carlyle would have pointed out with
justifiable satisfaction, hiding the theatre of man&rsquo;s
childish folly.&nbsp; You find, generally speaking, cobblers
happily employed in cobbling shoes, women gossipping cheerfully
over the washtub on the spot where a hundred years ago, according
to the guide-book, a thousand men dressed in blue and a thousand
men dressed in red rushed together like quarrelsome fox-terriers,
and worried each other to death.</p>
<p>But the field of Waterloo is little changed.&nbsp; The guide,
whose grandfather was present at the battle&mdash;quite an
extraordinary number of grandfathers must have fought at
Waterloo: there must have been whole regiments composed of
grandfathers&mdash;can point out to you the ground across which
every charge was delivered, can show you every ridge, still
existing, behind which the infantry crouched.&nbsp; The whole
business was began and finished within a space little larger than
a square mile.&nbsp; One can understand the advantage then to be
derived from the perfect moving of the military machine; the uses
of the echelon, the purposes of the linked battalion, the
manipulation of centre, left wing and right wing.&nbsp; Then it
may have been worth while&mdash;if war be ever worth the
while&mdash;which grown men of sense are beginning to
doubt&mdash;to waste two years of a soldier&rsquo;s training,
teaching him the goose-step.&nbsp; In the twentieth century,
teaching soldiers the evolutions of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
is about as sensible as it would be loading our iron-clads with
canvas.</p>
<p>I followed once a company of Volunteers across Blackfriars
Bridge on their way from Southwark to the Temple.&nbsp; At the
bottom of Ludgate Hill the commanding officer, a young but
conscientious gentleman, ordered &ldquo;Left wheel!&rdquo;&nbsp;
At once the vanguard turned down a narrow alley&mdash;I forget
its name&mdash;which would have led the troop into the purlieus
of Whitefriars, where, in all probability, they would have been
lost for ever.&nbsp; The whole company had to be halted,
right-about-faced, and retired a hundred yards.&nbsp; Then the
order &ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; was given.&nbsp; The vanguard
shot across Ludgate Circus, and were making for the Meat
Market.</p>
<p>At this point that young commanding officer gave up being a
military man and talked sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; he shouted: &ldquo;up Fleet Street
and through Middle Temple Lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then without further trouble the army of the future went upon
its way.</p>

122</span>OUGHT STORIES TO BE TRUE?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a
charming young lady, possessed of much taste, who was asked by
her anxious parent, the years passing and family expenditure not
decreasing, which of the numerous and eligible young men then
paying court to her she liked the best.&nbsp; She replied, that
was her difficulty; she could not make up her mind which she
liked the best.&nbsp; They were all so nice.&nbsp; She could not
possibly select one to the exclusion of all the others.&nbsp;
What she would have liked would have been to marry the lot; but
that, she presumed, was impracticable.</p>
<p>I feel I resemble that young lady, not so much in charm and
beauty as in indecision of mind, when the question is that of my
favourite author or my favourite book.&nbsp; It is as if one were
asked one&rsquo;s favourite food.&nbsp; There are times when one
fancies an egg with one&rsquo;s tea.&nbsp; On other occasions one
dreams of a kipper.&nbsp; To-day one clamours for lobsters.&nbsp;
To-morrow one feels one never wishes to see a lobster
again.&nbsp; One determines to settle down, for a time, to a diet
of bread and milk and rice pudding.&nbsp; Asked suddenly to say
whether I preferred ices to soup, or beef-steak to caviare, I
should be completely nonplussed.</p>
<p>There may be readers who care for only one literary
diet.&nbsp; I am a person of gross appetites, requiring many
authors to satisfy me.&nbsp; There are moods when the savage
strength of the Bronte sisters is companionable to me.&nbsp; One
rejoices in the unrelieved gloom of &ldquo;Wuthering
Heights,&rdquo; as in the lowering skies of a stormy
autumn.&nbsp; Perhaps part of the marvel of the book comes from
the knowledge that the authoress was a slight, delicate young
girl.&nbsp; One wonders what her future work would have been, had
she lived to gain a wider experience of life; or was it well for
her fame that nature took the pen so soon from her hand?&nbsp;
Her suppressed vehemence may have been better suited to those
tangled Yorkshire byways than to the more open, cultivated fields
of life.</p>
<p>There is not much similarity between the two books, yet when
recalling Emily Bronte my thoughts always run on to Olive
Schreiner.&nbsp; Here, again, was a young girl with the voice of
a strong man.&nbsp; Olive Schreiner, more fortunate, has lived;
but I doubt if she will ever write a book that will remind us of
her first.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Story of an African Farm&rdquo; is
not a work to be repeated.&nbsp; We have advanced in literature
of late.&nbsp; I can well remember the storm of indignation with
which the &ldquo;African Farm&rdquo; was received by Mrs. Grundy
and her then numerous, but now happily diminishing, school.&nbsp;
It was a book that was to be kept from the hands of every young
man and woman.&nbsp; But the hands of the young men and women
stretched out and grasped it, to their help.&nbsp; It is a
curious idea, this of Mrs. Grundy&rsquo;s, that the young man and
woman must never think&mdash;that all literature that does
anything more than echo the conventions must be hidden away.</p>
<p>Then there are times when I love to gallop through history on
Sir Walter&rsquo;s broomstick.&nbsp; At other hours it is
pleasant to sit in converse with wise George Eliot.&nbsp; From
her garden terrace I look down on Loamshire and its commonplace
people; while in her quiet, deep voice she tells me of the hidden
hearts that beat and throb beneath these velveteen jackets and
lace falls.</p>
<p>Who can help loving Thackeray, wittiest, gentlest of men, in
spite of the faint suspicion of snobbishness that clings to
him?&nbsp; There is something pathetic in the good man&rsquo;s
horror of this snobbishness, to which he himself was a
victim.&nbsp; May it not have been an affectation, born
unconsciously of self-consciousness?&nbsp; His heroes and
heroines must needs be all fine folk, fit company for lady and
gentlemen readers.&nbsp; To him the livery was too often the
man.&nbsp; Under his stuffed calves even <i>Jeames de la
Pluche</i> himself stood upon the legs of a man, but Thackeray
could never see deeper than the silk stockings.&nbsp; Thackeray
lived and died in Clubland.&nbsp; One feels that the world was
bounded for him by Temple Bar on the east and Park Lane on the
west; but what there was good in Clubland he showed us, and for
the sake of the great gentlemen and sweet ladies that his kindly
eyes found in that narrow region, not too overpeopled with great
gentlemen and sweet women, let us honour him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Jones,&rdquo; &ldquo;Peregrine Pickle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Tristram Shandy&rdquo; are books a man is the better for
reading, if he read them wisely.&nbsp; They teach him that
literature, to be a living force, must deal with all sides of
life, and that little help comes to us from that silly pretence
of ours that we are perfect in all things, leading perfect lives,
that only the villain of the story ever deviates from the path of
rectitude.</p>
<p>This is a point that needs to be considered by both the makers
and the buyers of stories.&nbsp; If literature is to be regarded
solely as the amusement of an idle hour, then the less
relationship it has to life the better.&nbsp; Looking into a
truthful mirror of nature we are compelled to think; and when
thought comes in at the window self-satisfaction goes out by the
door.&nbsp; Should a novel or play call us to ponder upon the
problems of existence, or lure us from the dusty high road of the
world, for a while, into the pleasant meadows of dreamland?&nbsp;
If only the latter, then let our heroes and our heroines be not
what men and women are, but what they should be.&nbsp; Let
Angelina be always spotless and Edwin always true.&nbsp; Let
virtue ever triumph over villainy in the last chapter; and let us
assume that the marriage service answers all the questions of the
Sphinx.</p>
<p>Very pleasant are these fairy tales where the prince is always
brave and handsome; where the princess is always the best and
most beautiful princess that ever lived; where one knows the
wicked people at a glance by their ugliness and ill-temper,
mistakes being thus rendered impossible; where the good fairies
are, by nature, more powerful than the bad; where gloomy paths
lead ever to fair palaces; where the dragon is ever vanquished;
and where well-behaved husbands and wives can rely upon living
happily ever afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world is too much with
us, late and soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is wise to slip away from it
at times to fairyland.&nbsp; But, alas, we cannot live in
fairyland, and knowledge of its geography is of little help to us
on our return to the rugged country of reality.</p>
<p>Are not both branches of literature needful?&nbsp; By all
means let us dream, on midsummer nights, of fond lovers led
through devious paths to happiness by Puck; of virtuous
dukes&mdash;one finds such in fairyland; of fate subdued by faith
and gentleness.&nbsp; But may we not also, in our more serious
humours, find satisfaction in thinking with Hamlet or
Coriolanus?&nbsp; May not both Dickens and Zola have their booths
in Vanity Fair?&nbsp; If literature is to be a help to us, as
well as a pastime, it must deal with the ugly as well as with the
beautiful; it must show us ourselves, not as we wish to appear,
but as we know ourselves to be.&nbsp; Man has been described as a
animal with aspirations reaching up to Heaven and instincts
rooted&mdash;elsewhere.&nbsp; Is literature to flatter him, or
reveal him to himself?</p>
<p>Of living writers it is not safe, I suppose, to speak except,
perhaps, of those who have been with us so long that we have come
to forget they are not of the past.&nbsp; Has justice ever been
done to Ouida&rsquo;s undoubted genius by our shallow school of
criticism, always very clever in discovering faults as obvious as
pimples on a fine face?&nbsp; Her guardsmen &ldquo;toy&rdquo;
with their food.&nbsp; Her horses win the Derby three years
running.&nbsp; Her wicked women throw guinea peaches from the
windows of the Star and Garter into the Thames at Richmond.&nbsp;
The distance being about three hundred and fifty yards, it is a
good throw.&nbsp; Well, well, books are not made worth reading by
the absence of absurdities.&nbsp; Ouida possesses strength,
tenderness, truth, passion; and these be qualities in a writer
capable of carrying many more faults than Ouida is burdened
with.&nbsp; But that is the method of our little criticism.&nbsp;
It views an artist as Gulliver saw the Brobdingnag ladies.&nbsp;
It is too small to see them in their entirety: a mole or a wart
absorbs all its vision.</p>
<p>Why was not George Gissing more widely read?&nbsp; If
faithfulness to life were the key to literary success,
Gissing&rsquo;s sales would have been counted by the million
instead of by the hundred.</p>
<p>Have Mark Twain&rsquo;s literary qualities, apart altogether
from his humour, been recognised in literary circles as they
ought to have been? &ldquo;Huck Finn&rdquo; would be a great work
were there not a laugh in it from cover to cover.&nbsp; Among the
Indians and some other savage tribes the fact that a member of
the community has lost one of his senses makes greatly to his
advantage; he is then regarded as a superior person.&nbsp; So
among a school of Anglo-Saxon readers, it is necessary to a man,
if he would gain literary credit, that he should lack the sense
of humour.&nbsp; One or two curious modern examples occur to me
of literary success secured chiefly by this failing.</p>
<p>All these authors are my favourites; but such catholic taste
is held nowadays to be no taste.&nbsp; One is told that if one
loves Shakespeare, one must of necessity hate Ibsen; that one
cannot appreciate Wagner and tolerate Beethoven; that if we admit
any merit in Dore, we are incapable of understanding
Whistler.&nbsp; How can I say which is my favourite novel?&nbsp;
I can only ask myself which lives clearest in my memory, which is
the book I run to more often than to another in that pleasant
half hour before the dinner-bell, when, with all apologies to
good Mr. Smiles, it is useless to think of work.</p>
<p>I find, on examination, that my &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo; is more dilapidated than any other novel upon
my shelves.&nbsp; As I turn its dog-eared pages, reading the
familiar headlines &ldquo;Mr. Micawber in difficulties,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Micawber in prison,&rdquo; &ldquo;I fall in love with
Dora,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Barkis goes out with the tide,&rdquo;
&ldquo;My child wife,&rdquo; &ldquo;Traddles in a nest of
roses&rdquo;&mdash;pages of my own life recur to me; so many of
my sorrows, so many of my joys are woven in my mind with this
chapter or the other.&nbsp; That day&mdash;how well I remember it
when I read of &ldquo;David&rsquo;s&rdquo; wooing, but
Dora&rsquo;s death I was careful to skip.&nbsp; Poor, pretty
little Mrs. Copperfield at the gate, holding up her baby in her
arms, is always associated in my memory with a child&rsquo;s cry,
long listened for.&nbsp; I found the book, face downwards on a
chair, weeks afterwards, not moved from where I had hastily laid
it.</p>
<p>Old friends, all of you, how many times have I not slipped
away from my worries into your pleasant company!&nbsp; Peggotty,
you dear soul, the sight of your kind eyes is so good to
me.&nbsp; Our mutual friend, Mr. Charles Dickens, is prone, we
know, just ever so slightly to gush.&nbsp; Good fellow that he
is, he can see no flaw in those he loves, but you, dear lady, if
you will permit me to call you by a name much abused, he has
drawn in true colours.&nbsp; I know you well, with your big
heart, your quick temper, your homely, human ways of
thought.&nbsp; You yourself will never guess your worth&mdash;how
much the world is better for such as you!&nbsp; You think of
yourself as of a commonplace person, useful only for the making
of pastry, the darning of stockings, and if a man&mdash;not a
young man, with only dim half-opened eyes, but a man whom life
had made keen to see the beauty that lies hidden beneath plain
faces&mdash;were to kneel and kiss your red, coarse hand, you
would be much astonished.&nbsp; But he would be a wise man,
Peggotty, knowing what things a man should take carelessly, and
for what things he should thank God, who has fashioned fairness
in many forms.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins Micawber, and you, most excellent of faithful
wives, Mrs. Emma Micawber, to you I also raise my hat.&nbsp; How
often has the example of your philosophy saved me, when I,
likewise, have suffered under the temporary pressure of pecuniary
liabilities; when the sun of my prosperity, too, has sunk beneath
the dark horizon of the world&mdash;in short, when I, also, have
found myself in a tight corner.&nbsp; I have asked myself what
would the Micawbers have done in my place.&nbsp; And I have
answered myself.&nbsp; They would have sat down to a dish of
lamb&rsquo;s fry, cooked and breaded by the deft hands of Emma,
followed by a brew of punch, concocted by the beaming Wilkins,
and have forgotten all their troubles, for the time being.&nbsp;
Whereupon, seeing first that sufficient small change was in my
pocket, I have entered the nearest restaurant, and have treated
myself to a repast of such sumptuousness as the aforesaid small
change would command, emerging from that restaurant stronger and
more fit for battle.&nbsp; And lo! the sun of my prosperity has
peeped at me from over the clouds with a sly wink, as if to say
&ldquo;Cheer up; I am only round the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheery, elastic Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, how would half the
world face their fate but by the help of a kindly, shallow nature
such as yours?&nbsp; I love to think that your sorrows can be
drowned in nothing more harmful than a bowl of punch.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s to you, Emma, and to you, Wilkins, and to the
twins!</p>
<p>May you and such childlike folk trip lightly over the stones
upon your path!&nbsp; May something ever turn up for you, my
dears!&nbsp; May the rain of life ever fall as April showers upon
your simple bald head, Micawber!</p>
<p>And you, sweet Dora, let me confess I love you, though
sensible friends deem you foolish.&nbsp; Ah, silly Dora,
fashioned by wise Mother Nature who knows that weakness and
helplessness are as a talisman calling forth strength and
tenderness in man, trouble yourself not unduly about the oysters
and the underdone mutton, little woman.&nbsp; Good plain cooks at
twenty pounds a year will see to these things for us.&nbsp; Your
work is to teach us gentleness and kindness.&nbsp; Lay your
foolish curls just here, child.&nbsp; It is from such as you we
learn wisdom.&nbsp; Foolish wise folk sneer at you.&nbsp; Foolish
wise folk would pull up the laughing lilies, the needless roses
from the garden, would plant in their places only useful,
wholesome cabbage.&nbsp; But the gardener, knowing better, plants
the silly, short-lived flowers, foolish wise folk asking for what
purpose.</p>
<p>Gallant Traddles, of the strong heart and the unruly hair;
Sophy, dearest of girls; Betsy Trotwood, with your gentlemanly
manners and your woman&rsquo;s heart, you have come to me in
shabby rooms, making the dismal place seem bright.&nbsp; In dark
hours your kindly faces have looked out at me from the shadows,
your kindly voices have cheered me.</p>
<p>Little Em&rsquo;ly and Agnes, it may be my bad taste, but I
cannot share my friend Dickens&rsquo; enthusiasm for them.&nbsp;
Dickens&rsquo; good women are all too good for human
nature&rsquo;s daily food.&nbsp; Esther Summerson, Florence
Dombey, Little Nell&mdash;you have no faults to love you by.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s women were likewise mere illuminated
texts.&nbsp; Scott only drew one live heroine&mdash;Catherine
Seton.&nbsp; His other women were merely the prizes the hero had
to win in the end, like the sucking pig or the leg of mutton for
which the yokel climbs the greasy pole.&nbsp; That Dickens could
draw a woman to some likeness he proved by Bella Wilfer, and
Estella in &ldquo;Great Expectations.&rdquo;&nbsp; But real women
have never been popular in fiction.&nbsp; Men readers prefer the
false, and women readers object to the truth.</p>
<p>From an artistic point of view, &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo; is undoubtedly Dickens&rsquo; best work.&nbsp;
Its humour is less boisterous; its pathos less highly
coloured.</p>
<p>One of Leech&rsquo;s pictures represents a cab-man calmly
sleeping in the gutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor dear, he&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; says a
tender-hearted lady in the crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ill!&rdquo;
retorts a male bystander indignantly, &ldquo;Ill!
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad too much of what I ain&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ad enough of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dickens suffered from too little of what some of us have too
much of&mdash;criticism.&nbsp; His work met with too little
resistance to call forth his powers.&nbsp; Too often his pathos
sinks to bathos, and this not from want of skill, but from want
of care.&nbsp; It is difficult to believe that the popular writer
who allowed his sentimentality&mdash;or rather the public&rsquo;s
sentimentality&mdash;to run away with him in such scenes as the
death of Paul Dombey and Little Nell was the artist who painted
the death of Sidney Carton and of Barkis, the willing.&nbsp; The
death of Barkis, next to the passing of Colonel Newcome, is, to
my thinking, one of the most perfect pieces of pathos in English
literature.&nbsp; No very deep emotion is concerned.&nbsp; He is
a commonplace old man, clinging foolishly to a commonplace
box.&nbsp; His simple wife and the old boatmen stand by, waiting
calmly for the end.&nbsp; There is no straining after
effect.&nbsp; One feels death enter, dignifying all things; and
touched by that hand, foolish old Barkis grows great.</p>
<p>In Uriah Heap and Mrs. Gummidge, Dickens draws types rather
than characters.&nbsp; Pecksniff, Podsnap, Dolly Varden, Mr.
Bumble, Mrs. Gamp, Mark Tapley, Turveydrop, Mrs.
Jellyby&mdash;these are not characters; they are human
characteristics personified.</p>
<p>We have to go back to Shakespeare to find a writer who,
through fiction, has so enriched the thought of the people.&nbsp;
Admit all Dickens&rsquo; faults twice over, we still have one of
the greatest writers of modern times.&nbsp; Such people as these
creations of Dickens never lived, says your little critic.&nbsp;
Nor was Prometheus, type of the spirit of man, nor was Niobe,
mother of all mothers, a truthful picture of the citizen one was
likely to meet often during a morning&rsquo;s stroll through
Athens.&nbsp; Nor grew there ever a wood like to the Forest of
Arden, though every Rosalind and Orlando knows the path to glades
having much resemblance thereto.</p>
<p>Steerforth, upon whom Dickens evidently prided himself, I must
confess, never laid hold of me.&nbsp; He is a melodramatic young
man.&nbsp; The worst I could have wished him would have been that
he should marry Rose Dartle and live with his mother.&nbsp; It
would have served him right for being so attractive.&nbsp; Old
Peggotty and Ham are, of course, impossible.&nbsp; One must
accept them also as types.&nbsp; These Brothers Cheeryble, these
Kits, Joe Gargeries, Boffins, Garlands, John Peerybingles, we
will accept as types of the goodness that is in men&mdash;though
in real life the amount of virtue that Dickens often wastes upon
a single individual would by more economically minded nature, be
made to serve for fifty.</p>
<p>To sum up, &ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; is a plain tale,
simply told; and such are all books that live.&nbsp;
Eccentricities of style, artistic trickery, may please the critic
of a day, but literature is a story that interests us, boys and
girls, men and women.&nbsp; It is a sad book; and that, again,
gives it an added charm in these sad later days.&nbsp; Humanity
is nearing its old age, and we have come to love sadness, as the
friend who has been longest with us.&nbsp; In the young days of
our vigour we were merry.&nbsp; With Ulysses&rsquo; boatmen, we
took alike the sunshine and the thunder with frolic
welcome.&nbsp; The red blood flowed in our veins, and we laughed,
and our tales were of strength and hope.&nbsp; Now we sit like
old men, watching faces in the fire; and the stories that we love
are sad stories&mdash;like the stories we ourselves have
lived.</p>

141</span>CREATURES THAT ONE DAY SHALL BE MEN.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">ought</span> to like Russia better than
I do, if only for the sake of the many good friends I am proud to
possess amongst the Russians.&nbsp; A large square photograph I
keep always on my mantel-piece; it helps me to maintain my head
at that degree of distention necessary for the performance of all
literary work.&nbsp; It presents in the centre a neatly-written
address in excellent English that I frankly confess I am never
tired of reading, around which are ranged some hundreds of names
I am quite unable to read, but which, in spite of their strange
lettering, I know to be the names of good Russian men and women
to whom, a year or two ago, occurred the kindly idea of sending
me as a Christmas card this message of encouragement.&nbsp; The
individual Russian is one of the most charming creatures
living.&nbsp; If he like you he does not hesitate to let you know
it; not only by every action possible, but, by what perhaps is
just as useful in this grey old world, by generous, impulsive
speech.</p>
<p>We Anglo-Saxons are apt to pride ourselves upon being
undemonstrative.&nbsp; Max Adeler tells the tale of a boy who was
sent out by his father to fetch wood.&nbsp; The boy took the
opportunity of disappearing and did not show his face again
beneath the paternal roof for over twenty years.&nbsp; Then one
evening, a smiling, well-dressed stranger entered to the old
couple, and announced himself as their long-lost child, returned
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t hurried yourself,&rdquo;
grumbled the old man, &ldquo;and blarm me if now you
haven&rsquo;t forgotten the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was lunching with an Englishman in a London restaurant one
day.&nbsp; A man entered and took his seat at a table near
by.&nbsp; Glancing round, and meeting my friend&rsquo;s eyes, he
smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me a minute,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I
must just speak to my brother&mdash;haven&rsquo;t seen him for
over five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He finished his soup and leisurely wiped his moustache before
strolling across and shaking hands.&nbsp; They talked for a
while.&nbsp; Then my friend returned to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought to see him again,&rdquo; observed my
friend, &ldquo;he was one of the garrison of that place in
Africa&mdash;what&rsquo;s the name of it?&mdash;that the Mahdi
attacked.&nbsp; Only three of them escaped.&nbsp; Always was a
lucky beggar, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you like to talk to him some
more?&rdquo; I suggested; &ldquo;I can see you any time about
this little business of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;we have just fixed it up&mdash;shall be seeing him again
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of this scene one evening while dining with some
Russian friends in a St. Petersburg Hotel.&nbsp; One of the party
had not seen his second cousin, a mining engineer, for nearly
eighteen months.&nbsp; They sat opposite to one another, and a
dozen times at least during the course of the dinner one of them
would jump up from his chair, and run round to embrace the
other.&nbsp; They would throw their arms about one another,
kissing one another on both cheeks, and then sit down again, with
moist eyes.&nbsp; Their behaviour among their fellow countrymen
excited no astonishment whatever.</p>
<p>But the Russians&rsquo;s anger is as quick and vehement as his
love.&nbsp; On another occasion I was supping with friends in one
of the chief restaurants on the Nevsky.&nbsp; Two gentlemen at an
adjoining table, who up till the previous moment had been engaged
in amicable conversation, suddenly sprang to their feet, and
&ldquo;went for&rdquo; one another.&nbsp; One man secured the
water-bottle, which he promptly broke over the other&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; His opponent chose for his weapon a heavy mahogany
chair, and leaping back for the purpose of securing a good swing,
lurched against my hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do please be careful,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, madame,&rdquo; returned the
stranger, from whom blood and water were streaming in equal
copiousness; and taking the utmost care to avoid interfering with
our comfort, he succeeded adroitly in flooring his antagonist by
a well-directed blow.</p>
<p>A policeman appeared upon the scene.&nbsp; He did not attempt
to interfere, but running out into the street communicated the
glad tidings to another policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to cost them a pretty penny,&rdquo;
observed my host, who was calmly continuing his supper;
&ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t they wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did cost them a pretty penny.&nbsp; Some half a dozen
policemen were round about before as many minutes had elapsed,
and each one claimed his bribe.&nbsp; Then they wished both
combatants good-night, and trooped out evidently in great good
humour and the two gentlemen, with wet napkins round their heads,
sat down again, and laughter and amicable conversation flowed
freely as before.</p>
<p>They strike the stranger as a childlike people, but you are
possessed with a haunting sense of ugly traits beneath.&nbsp; The
workers&mdash;slaves it would be almost more correct to call
them&mdash;allow themselves to be exploited with the
uncomplaining patience of intelligent animals.&nbsp; Yet every
educated Russian you talk to on the subject knows that revolution
is coming.</p>
<p>But he talks to you about it with the door shut, for no man in
Russia can be sure that his own servants are not police
spies.&nbsp; I was discussing politics with a Russian official
one evening in his study when his old housekeeper entered the
room&mdash;a soft-eyed grey-haired woman who had been in his
service over eight years, and whose position in the household was
almost that of a friend.&nbsp; He stopped abruptly and changed
the conversation.&nbsp; So soon as the door was closed behind her
again, he explained himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better to chat upon such matters when one is
quite alone,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you can trust her,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;She
appears to be devoted to you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is safer to trust no one,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
And then he continued from the point where we had been
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gathering,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there are times
when I almost smell blood in the air.&nbsp; I am an old man and
may escape it, but my children will have to suffer&mdash;suffer
as children must for the sins of their fathers.&nbsp; We have
made brute beasts of the people, and as brute beasts they will
come upon us, cruel, and undiscriminating; right and wrong
indifferently going down before them.&nbsp; But it has to
be.&nbsp; It is needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a mistake to speak of the Russian classes opposing to
all progress a dead wall of selfishness.&nbsp; The history of
Russia will be the history of the French Revolution over again,
but with this difference: that the educated classes, the
thinkers, who are pushing forward the dumb masses are doing so
with their eyes open.&nbsp; There will be no Maribeau, no Danton
to be appalled at a people&rsquo;s ingratitude.&nbsp; The men who
are to-day working for revolution in Russia number among their
ranks statesmen, soldiers, delicately-nurtured women, rich
landowners, prosperous tradesmen, students familiar with the
lessons of history.&nbsp; They have no misconceptions concerning
the blind Monster into which they are breathing life.&nbsp; He
will crush them, they know it; but with them he will crush the
injustice and stupidity they have grown to hate more than they
love themselves.</p>
<p>The Russian peasant, when he rises, will prove more terrible,
more pitiless than were the men of 1790.&nbsp; He is less
intelligent, more brutal.&nbsp; They sing a wild, sad song, these
Russian cattle, the while they work.&nbsp; They sing it in chorus
on the quays while hauling the cargo, they sing it in the
factory, they chant on the weary, endless steppes, reaping the
corn they may not eat.&nbsp; It is of the good time their masters
are having, of the feastings and the merrymakings, of the
laughter of the children, of the kisses of the lovers.</p>
<p>But the last line of every verse is the same.&nbsp; When you
ask a Russian to translate it for you he shrugs his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it means,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that their time
will also come&mdash;some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a pathetic, haunting refrain.&nbsp; They sing it in the
drawing-rooms of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and somehow the light
talk and laughter die away, and a hush, like a chill breath,
enters by the closed door and passes through.&nbsp; It is a
curious song, like the wailing of a tired wind, and one day it
will sweep over the land heralding terror.</p>
<p>A Scotsman I met in Russia told me that when he first came out
to act as manager of a large factory in St. Petersburg, belonging
to his Scottish employers, he unwittingly made a mistake the
first week when paying his workpeople.&nbsp; By a miscalculation
of the Russian money he paid the men, each one, nearly a rouble
short.&nbsp; He discovered his error before the following
Saturday, and then put the matter right.&nbsp; The men accepted
his explanation with perfect composure and without any comment
whatever.&nbsp; The thing astonished him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have known I was paying you short,&rdquo;
he said to one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;we thought you were
putting it in your own pocket and then if we had complained it
would have meant dismissal for us.&nbsp; No one would have taken
our word against yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corruption appears to be so general throughout the whole of
Russia that all classes have come to accept it as part of the
established order of things.&nbsp; A friend gave me a little dog
to bring away with me.&nbsp; It was a valuable animal, and I
wished to keep it with me.&nbsp; It is strictly forbidden to take
dogs into railway carriages.&nbsp; The list of the pains and
penalties for doing so frightened me considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,&rdquo; my friend assured
me; &ldquo;have a few roubles loose in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tipped the station master and I tipped the guard, and
started pleased with myself.&nbsp; But I had not anticipated what
was in store for me.&nbsp; The news that an Englishman with a dog
in a basket and roubles in his pocket was coming must have been
telegraphed all down the line.&nbsp; At almost every
stopping-place some enormous official, wearing generally a sword
and a helmet, boarded the train.&nbsp; At first these fellows
terrified me.&nbsp; I took them for field-marshals at least.</p>
<p>Visions of Siberia crossed my mind.&nbsp; Anxious and
trembling, I gave the first one a gold piece.&nbsp; He shook me
warmly by the hand&mdash;I thought he was going to kiss me.&nbsp;
If I had offered him my cheek I am sure he would have done
so.&nbsp; With the next one I felt less apprehensive.&nbsp; For a
couple of roubles he blessed me, so I gathered; and, commending
me to the care of the Almighty, departed.&nbsp; Before I had
reached the German frontier, I was giving away the equivalent of
English sixpences to men with the dress and carriage of
major-generals; and to see their faces brighten up and to receive
their heartfelt benediction was well worth the money.</p>
<p>But to the man without roubles in his pocket, Russian
officialdom is not so gracious.&nbsp; By the expenditure of a few
more coins I got my dog through the Customs without trouble, and
had leisure to look about me.&nbsp; A miserable object was being
badgered by half a dozen men in uniform, and he&mdash;his lean
face puckered up into a snarl&mdash;was returning them snappish
answers; the whole scene suggested some half-starved mongrel
being worried by school-boys.&nbsp; A slight informality had been
discovered in his passport, so a fellow traveller with whom I had
made friends informed me.&nbsp; He had no roubles in his pocket,
and in consequence they were sending him back to St.
Petersburg&mdash;some eighteen hours&rsquo; journey&mdash;in a
wagon that in England would not be employed for the transport of
oxen.</p>
<p>It seemed a good joke to Russian officialdom; they would drop
in every now and then, look at him as he sat crouched in a corner
of the waiting-room, and pass out again, laughing.&nbsp; The
snarl had died from his face; a dull, listless indifference had
taken its place&mdash;the look one sees on the face of a beaten
dog, after the beating is over, when it is lying very still, its
great eyes staring into nothingness, and one wonders whether it
is thinking.</p>
<p>The Russian worker reads no newspaper, has no club, yet all
things seem to be known to him.&nbsp; There is a prison on the
banks of the Neva, in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; They say such things
are done with now, but up till very recently there existed a
small cell therein, below the level of the ice, and prisoners
placed there would be found missing a day or two afterwards,
nothing ever again known of them, except, perhaps, to the fishes
of the Baltic.&nbsp; They talk of such like things among
themselves: the sleigh-drivers round their charcoal fire, the
field-workers going and coming in the grey dawn, the factory
workers, their whispers deadened by the rattle of the looms.</p>
<p>I was searching for a house in Brussels some winters ago, and
there was one I was sent to in a small street leading out of the
Avenue Louise.&nbsp; It was poorly furnished, but rich in
pictures, large and small.&nbsp; They covered the walls of every
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These pictures,&rdquo; explained to me the landlady, an
old, haggard-looking woman, &ldquo;will not be left, I am taking
them with me to London.&nbsp; They are all the work of my
husband.&nbsp; He is arranging an exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friend who had sent me had told me the woman was a widow,
who had been living in Brussels eking out a precarious existence
as a lodging-house keeper for the last ten years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have married again?&rdquo; I questioned her.</p>
<p>The woman smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not again.&nbsp; I was married eighteen years ago in
Russia.&nbsp; My husband was transported to Siberia a few days
after we were married, and I have never seen him
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have followed him,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;only every year we thought he was going to be set
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is really free now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They set him
free last week.&nbsp; He will join me in London.&nbsp; We shall
be able to finish our honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, revealing to me that once she had been a girl.</p>
<p>I read in the English papers of the exhibition in
London.&nbsp; It was said the artist showed much promise.&nbsp;
So possibly a career may at last be opening out for him.</p>
<p>Nature has made life hard to Russian rich and poor
alike.&nbsp; To the banks of the Neva, with its ague and
influenza-bestowing fogs and mists, one imagines that the Devil
himself must have guided Peter the Great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me in all my dominions the most hopelessly
unattractive site on which to build a city,&rdquo; Peter must
have prayed; and the Devil having discovered the site on which
St. Petersburg now stands, must have returned to his master in
high good feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, my dear Peter, I have found you something
really unique.&nbsp; It is a pestilent swamp to which a mighty
river brings bitter blasts and marrow-chilling fogs, while during
the brief summer time the wind will bring you sand.&nbsp; In this
way you will combine the disadvantages of the North Pole with
those of the desert of Sahara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the winter time the Russians light their great stoves, and
doubly barricade their doors and windows; and in this atmosphere,
like to that of a greenhouse, many of their women will pass six
months, never venturing out of doors.&nbsp; Even the men only go
out at intervals.&nbsp; Every office, every shop is an
oven.&nbsp; Men of forty have white hair and parchment faces; and
the women are old at thirty.&nbsp; The farm labourers, during the
few summer months, work almost entirely without sleep.&nbsp; They
leave that for the winter, when they shut themselves up like
dormice in their hovels, their store of food and vodka buried
underneath the floor.&nbsp; For days together they sleep, then
wake and dig, then sleep again.</p>
<p>The Russian party lasts all night.&nbsp; In an adjoining room
are beds and couches; half a dozen guests are always
sleeping.&nbsp; An hour contents them, then they rejoin the
company, and other guests take their places.&nbsp; The Russian
eats when he feels so disposed; the table is always spread, the
guests come and go.&nbsp; Once a year there is a great feast in
Moscow.&nbsp; The Russian merchant and his friends sit down early
in the day, and a sort of thick, sweet pancake is served up
hot.&nbsp; The feast continues for many hours, and the ambition
of the Russian merchant is to eat more than his neighbour.&nbsp;
Fifty or sixty of these hot cakes a man will consume at a
sitting, and a dozen funerals in Moscow is often the result.</p>
<p>An uncivilised people, we call them in our lordly way, but
they are young.&nbsp; Russian history is not yet three hundred
years old.&nbsp; They will see us out, I am inclined to
think.&nbsp; Their energy, their intelligence&mdash;when these
show above the groundwork&mdash;are monstrous.&nbsp; I have known
a Russian learn Chinese within six months.&nbsp; English! they
learn it while you are talking to them.&nbsp; The children play
at chess and study the violin for their own amusement.</p>
<p>The world will be glad of Russia&mdash;when she has put her
house in order.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>HOW
TO BE HAPPY THOUGH LITTLE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Folks</span> suffering from Jingoism,
Spreadeagleism, Chauvinism&mdash;all such like isms, to whatever
country they belong&mdash;would be well advised to take a tour in
Holland.&nbsp; It is the idea of the moment that size spells
happiness.&nbsp; The bigger the country the better one is for
living there.&nbsp; The happiest Frenchman cannot possibly be as
happy as the most wretched Britisher, for the reason that Britain
owns many more thousands of square miles than France
possesses.&nbsp; The Swiss peasant, compared with the Russian
serf, must, when he looks at the map of Europe and Asia, feel
himself to be a miserable creature.&nbsp; The reason that
everybody in America is happy and good is to be explained by the
fact that America has an area equal to that of the entire
moon.&nbsp; The American citizen who has backed the wrong horse,
missed his train and lost his bag, remembers this and feels
bucked up again.</p>
<p>According to this argument, fishes should be the happiest of
mortals, the sea consisting&mdash;at least, so says my atlas: I
have not measured it myself&mdash;of a hundred and forty-four
millions of square miles.&nbsp; But, maybe, the sea is also
divided in ways we wot not of.&nbsp; Possibly the sardine who
lives near the Brittainy coast is sad and discontented because
the Norwegian sardine is the proud inhabitant of a larger
sea.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why he has left the Brittainy
coast.&nbsp; Ashamed of being a Brittainy sardine, he has
emigrated to Norway, has become a naturalized Norwegian sardine,
and is himself again.</p>
<p>The happy Londoner on foggy days can warm himself with the
reflection that the sun never sets on the British Empire.&nbsp;
He does not often see the sun, but that is a mere detail.&nbsp;
He regards himself as the owner of the sun; the sun begins his
little day in the British Empire, ends his little day in the
British Empire: for all practical purposes the sun is part of the
British Empire.&nbsp; Foolish people in other countries sit
underneath it and feel warm, but that is only their
ignorance.&nbsp; They do not know it is a British possession; if
they did they would feel cold.</p>
<p>My views on this subject are, I know, heretical.&nbsp; I
cannot get it into my unpatriotic head that size is the only
thing worth worrying about.&nbsp; In England, when I venture to
express my out-of-date opinions, I am called a Little
Englander.&nbsp; It fretted me at first; I was becoming a mere
shadow.&nbsp; But by now I have got used to it.&nbsp; It would be
the same, I feel, wherever I went.&nbsp; In New York I should be
a Little American; in Constantinople a Little Turk.&nbsp; But I
wanted to talk about Holland.&nbsp; A holiday in Holland serves
as a corrective to exaggerated Imperialistic notions.</p>
<p>There are no poor in Holland.&nbsp; They may be an unhappy
people, knowing what a little country it is they live in; but, if
so, they hide the fact.&nbsp; To all seeming, the Dutch peasant,
smoking his great pipe, is as much a man as the Whitechapel
hawker or the moocher of the Paris boulevard.&nbsp; I saw a
beggar once in Holland&mdash;in the townlet of Enkhuisen.&nbsp;
Crowds were hurrying up from the side streets to have a look at
him; the idea at first seemed to be that he was doing it for a
bet.&nbsp; He turned out to be a Portuguese.&nbsp; They offered
him work in the docks&mdash;until he could get something better
to do&mdash;at wages equal in English money to about ten
shillings a day.&nbsp; I inquired about him on my way back, and
was told he had borrowed a couple of forms from the foreman and
had left by the evening train.&nbsp; It is not the country for
the loafer.</p>
<p>In Holland work is easily found; this takes away the charm of
looking for it.&nbsp; A farm labourer in Holland lives in a
brick-built house of six rooms, which generally belongs to him,
with an acre or so of ground, and only eats meat once a
day.&nbsp; The rest of his time he fills up on eggs and chicken
and cheese and beer.&nbsp; But you rarely hear him grumble.&nbsp;
His wife and daughter may be seen on Sundays wearing gold and
silver jewellery worth from fifty to one hundred pounds, and
there is generally enough old delft and pewter in the house to
start a local museum anywhere outside Holland.&nbsp; On high days
and holidays, of which in Holland there are plenty, the average
Dutch <i>vrouw</i> would be well worth running away with.&nbsp;
The Dutch peasant girl has no need of an illustrated journal once
a week to tell her what the fashion is; she has it in the
portrait of her mother, or of her grandmother, hanging over the
glittering chimney-piece.</p>
<p>When the Dutchwoman builds a dress she builds it to last; it
descends from mother to daughter, but it is made of sound
material in the beginning.&nbsp; A lady friend of mine thought
the Dutch costume would serve well for a fancy-dress ball, so set
about buying one, but abandoned the notion on learning what it
would cost her.&nbsp; A Dutch girl in her Sunday clothes must be
worth fifty pounds before you come to ornaments.&nbsp; In certain
provinces she wears a close-fitting helmet, made either of solid
silver or of solid gold.&nbsp; The Dutch gallant, before making
himself known, walks on tiptoe a little while behind the Loved
One, and looks at himself in her head-dress just to make sure
that his hat is on straight and his front curl just where it
ought to be.</p>
<p>In most other European countries national costume is dying
out.&nbsp; The slop-shop is year by year extending its hideous
trade.&nbsp; But the country of Rubens and Rembrandt, of Teniers
and Gerard Dow, remains still true to art.&nbsp; The picture
post-card does not exaggerate.&nbsp; The men in those wondrous
baggy knickerbockers, from the pockets of which you sometimes see
a couple of chicken&rsquo;s heads protruding; in gaudy coloured
shirts, in worsted hose and mighty sabots, smoking their great
pipes&mdash;the women in their petticoats of many hues, in
gorgeously embroidered vest, in chemisette of dazzling white,
crowned with a halo of many frills, glittering in gold and
silver&mdash;are not the creatures of an artist&rsquo;s
fancy.&nbsp; You meet them in their thousands on holiday
afternoons, walking gravely arm in arm, flirting with sober Dutch
stolidity.</p>
<p>On colder days the women wear bright-coloured capes made of
fine spun silk, from underneath the ample folds of which you
sometimes hear a little cry; and sometimes a little hooded head
peeps out, regards with preternatural thoughtfulness the toy-like
world without, then dives back into shelter.&nbsp; As for the
children&mdash;women in miniature, the single difference in dress
being the gay pinafore&mdash;you can only say of them that they
look like Dutch dolls.&nbsp; But such plump, contented, cheerful
little dolls!&nbsp; You remember the hollow-eyed, pale-faced
dolls you see swarming in the great, big and therefore should be
happy countries, and wish that mere land surface were of less
importance to our statesmen and our able editors, and the
happiness and well-being of the mere human items worth a little
more of their thought.</p>
<p>The Dutch peasant lives surrounded by canals, and reaches his
cottage across a drawbridge.&nbsp; I suppose it is in the blood
of the Dutch child not to tumble into a canal, and the Dutch
mother never appears to anticipate such possibility.&nbsp; One
can imagine the average English mother trying to bring up a
family in a house surrounded by canals.&nbsp; She would never
have a minute&rsquo;s peace until the children were in bed.&nbsp;
But then the mere sight of a canal to the English child suggests
the delights of a sudden and unexpected bath.&nbsp; I put it to a
Dutchman once.&nbsp; Did the Dutch child by any chance ever fall
into a canal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;cases have been
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do anything for it?&rdquo; I
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we haul them out
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I mean is,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you do anything to prevent their falling
in&mdash;to save them from falling in again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we spank
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is always a wind in Holland; it comes from over the
sea.&nbsp; There is nothing to stay its progress.&nbsp; It leaps
the low dykes and sweeps with a shriek across the sad, soft
dunes, and thinks it is going to have a good time and play havoc
in the land.&nbsp; But the Dutchman laughs behind his great pipe
as it comes to him shouting and roaring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Welcome, my
hearty, welcome,&rdquo; he chuckles, &ldquo;come blustering and
bragging; the bigger you are the better I like you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when it is once in the land, behind the long, straight dykes,
behind the waving line of sandy dunes, he seizes hold of it, and
will not let it go till it has done its tale of work.</p>
<p>The wind is the Dutchman&rsquo;s; servant before he lets it
loose again it has turned ten thousand mills, has pumped the
water and sawn the wood, has lighted the town and worked the
loom, and forged the iron, and driven the great, slow, silent
wherry, and played with the children in the garden.&nbsp; It is a
sober wind when it gets back to sea, worn and weary, leaving the
Dutchman laughing behind his everlasting pipe.&nbsp; There are
canals in Holland down which you pass as though a field of
wind-blown corn; a soft, low, rustling murmur ever in your
ears.&nbsp; It is the ceaseless whirl of the great mill
sails.&nbsp; Far out at sea the winds are as foolish savages,
fighting, shrieking, tearing&mdash;purposeless.&nbsp; Here, in
the street of mills, it is a civilized wind, crooning softly
while it labours.</p>
<p>What charms one in Holland is the neatness and cleanliness of
all about one.&nbsp; Maybe to the Dutchman there are
drawbacks.&nbsp; In a Dutch household life must be one long
spring-cleaning.&nbsp; No milk-pail is considered fit that cannot
just as well be used for a looking-glass.&nbsp; The great brass
pans, hanging under the pent house roof outside the cottage door,
flash like burnished gold.&nbsp; You could eat your dinner off
the red-tiled floor, but that the deal table, scrubbed to the
colour of cream cheese, is more convenient.&nbsp; By each
threshold stands a row of empty sabots, and woe-betide the
Dutchman who would dream of crossing it in anything but his
stockinged feet.</p>
<p>There is a fashion in sabots.&nbsp; Every spring they are
freshly painted.&nbsp; One district fancies an orange yellow,
another a red, a third white, suggesting purity and
innocence.&nbsp; Members of the Smart Set indulge in
ornamentation; a frieze in pink, a star upon the toe.&nbsp;
Walking in sabots is not as easy as it looks.&nbsp; Attempting to
run in sabots I do not recommend to the beginner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you run in sabots?&rdquo; I asked a Dutchman
once.&nbsp; I had been experimenting, and had hurt myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t run,&rdquo; answered the Dutchman.</p>
<p>And observation has proved to me he was right.&nbsp; The Dutch
boy, when he runs, puts them for preference on his hands, and
hits other Dutch boys over the head with them as he passes.</p>
<p>The roads in Holland, straight and level, and shaded all the
way with trees, look, from the railway-carriage window, as if
they would be good for cycling; but this is a delusion.&nbsp; I
crossed in the boat from Harwich once, with a well-known black
and white artist, and an equally well-known and highly respected
humorist.&nbsp; They had their bicycles with them, intending to
tour Holland.&nbsp; I met them a fortnight later in Delft, or,
rather, I met their remains.&nbsp; I was horrified at
first.&nbsp; I thought it was drink.&nbsp; They could not stand
still, they could not sit still, they trembled and shook in every
limb, their teeth chattered when they tried to talk.&nbsp; The
humorist hadn&rsquo;t a joke left in him.&nbsp; The artist could
not have drawn his own salary; he would have dropped it on the
way to his pocket.&nbsp; The Dutch roads are paved their entire
length with cobbles&mdash;big, round cobbles, over which your
bicycle leaps and springs and plunges.</p>
<p>If you would see Holland outside the big towns a smattering of
Dutch is necessary.&nbsp; If you know German there is not much
difficulty.&nbsp; Dutch&mdash;I speak as an amateur&mdash;appears
to be very bad German mis-pronounced.&nbsp; Myself, I find my
German goes well in Holland, even better than in Germany.&nbsp;
The Anglo-Saxon should not attempt the Dutch G.&nbsp; It is
hopeless to think of succeeding, and the attempt has been known
to produce internal rupture.&nbsp; The Dutchman appears to keep
his G in his stomach, and to haul it up when wanted.&nbsp;
Myself, I find the ordinary G, preceded by a hiccough and
followed by a sob, the nearest I can get to it.&nbsp; But they
tell me it is not quite right, yet.</p>
<p>One needs to save up beforehand if one desires to spend any
length of time in Holland.&nbsp; One talks of dear old England,
but the dearest land in all the world is little Holland.&nbsp;
The florin there is equal to the franc in France and to the
shilling in England.&nbsp; They tell you that cigars are cheap in
Holland.&nbsp; A cheap Dutch cigar will last you a day.&nbsp; It
is not until you have forgotten the taste of it that you feel you
ever want to smoke again.&nbsp; I knew a man who reckoned that he
had saved hundreds of pounds by smoking Dutch cigars for a month
steadily.&nbsp; It was years before he again ventured on
tobacco.</p>
<p>Watching building operations in Holland brings home to you
forcibly, what previously you have regarded as a meaningless
formula&mdash;namely, that the country is built upon piles.&nbsp;
A dozen feet below the level of the street one sees the labourers
working in fishermen&rsquo;s boots up to their knees in water,
driving the great wooden blocks into the mud.&nbsp; Many of the
older houses slope forward at such an angle that you almost fear
to pass beneath them.&nbsp; I should be as nervous as a kitten,
living in one of the upper storeys.&nbsp; But the Dutchman leans
out of a window that is hanging above the street six feet beyond
the perpendicular, and smokes contentedly.</p>
<p>They have a merry custom in Holland of keeping the railway
time twenty minutes ahead of the town time&mdash;or is it twenty
minutes behind?&nbsp; I never can remember when I&rsquo;m there,
and I am not sure now.&nbsp; The Dutchman himself never
knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve plenty of time,&rdquo; he says</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the train goes at ten,&rdquo; you say; &ldquo;the
station is a mile away, and it is now half-past nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that means ten-twenty,&rdquo; he answers,
&ldquo;you have nearly an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later he taps you on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistake, it&rsquo;s twenty to ten.&nbsp; I was
thinking it was the other way about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another argues with him that his first idea was right.&nbsp;
They work it out by scientific methods.&nbsp; Meanwhile you have
dived into a cab.&nbsp; The result is always the same: you are
either forty minutes too soon, or you have missed the train by
twenty minutes.&nbsp; A Dutch platform is always crowded with
women explaining volubly to their husbands either that there was
not any need to have hurried, or else that the thing would have
been to have started half an hour before they did, the man in
both cases being, of course, to blame.&nbsp; The men walk up and
down and swear.</p>
<p>The idea has been suggested that the railway time and the town
time should be made to conform.&nbsp; The argument against the
idea is that if it were carried out there would be nothing left
to put the Dutchman out and worry him.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>SHOULD WE SAY WHAT WE THINK, OR THINK WHAT WE SAY?</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">mad</span> friend of mine will have it
that the characteristic of the age is Make-Believe.&nbsp; He
argues that all social intercourse is founded on
make-believe.&nbsp; A servant enters to say that Mr. and Mrs.
Bore are in the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn!&rdquo; says the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; says the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut the
door, Susan.&nbsp; How often am I to tell you never to leave the
door open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man creeps upstairs on tiptoe and shuts himself in his
study.&nbsp; The woman does things before a looking-glass, waits
till she feels she is sufficiently mistress of herself not to
show her feelings, and then enters the drawing-room with
outstretched hands and the look of one welcoming an angel&rsquo;s
visit.&nbsp; She says how delighted she is to see the
Bores&mdash;how good it was of them to come.&nbsp; Why did they
not bring more Bores with them?&nbsp; Where is naughty Bore
junior?&nbsp; Why does he never come to see her now?&nbsp; She
will have to be really angry with him.&nbsp; And sweet little
Flossie Bore?&nbsp; Too young to pay calls!&nbsp; Nonsense.&nbsp;
An &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; day is not worth having where all the
Bores are not.</p>
<p>The Bores, who had hoped that she was out&mdash;who have only
called because the etiquette book told them that they must call
at least four times in the season, explain how they have been
trying and trying to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; recounts Mrs. Bore, &ldquo;we
were determined to come.&nbsp; &lsquo;John, dear,&rsquo; I said
this morning, &lsquo;I shall go and see dear Mrs. Bounder this
afternoon, no matter what happens.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea conveyed is that the Prince of Wales, on calling at
the Bores, was told that he could not come in.&nbsp; He might
call again in the evening or come some other day.</p>
<p>That afternoon the Bores were going to enjoy themselves in
their own way; they were going to see Mrs. Bounder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is Mr. Bounder?&rdquo; demands Mrs. Bore.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bounder remains mute for a moment, straining her
ears.&nbsp; She can hear him creeping past the door on his way
downstairs.&nbsp; She hears the front door softly opened and
closed-to.&nbsp; She wakes, as from a dream.&nbsp; She has been
thinking of the sorrow that will fall on Bounder when he returns
home later and learns what he has missed.</p>
<p>And thus it is, not only with the Bores and Bounders, but even
with us who are not Bores or Bounders.&nbsp; Society in all ranks
is founded on the make-believe that everybody is charming; that
we are delighted to see everybody; that everybody is delighted to
see us; that it is so good of everybody to come; that we are
desolate at the thought that they really must go now.</p>
<p>Which would we rather do&mdash;stop and finish our cigar or
hasten into the drawing-room to hear Miss Screecher sing?&nbsp;
Can you ask us?&nbsp; We tumble over each other in our
hurry.&nbsp; Miss Screecher would really rather not sing; but if
we insist&mdash;We do insist.&nbsp; Miss Screecher, with pretty
reluctance, consents.&nbsp; We are careful not to look at one
another.&nbsp; We sit with our eyes fixed on the ceiling.&nbsp;
Miss Screecher finishes, and rises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was so short,&rdquo; we say, so soon as we can
be heard above the applause.&nbsp; Is Miss Screecher quite sure
that was the whole of it?&nbsp; Or has she been playing tricks
upon us, the naughty lady, defrauding us of a verse?&nbsp; Miss
Screecher assures us that the fault is the
composer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But she knows another.&nbsp; At this
hint, our faces lighten again with gladness.&nbsp; We clamour for
more.</p>
<p>Our host&rsquo;s wine is always the most extraordinary we have
ever tasted.&nbsp; No, not another glass; we dare
not&mdash;doctor&rsquo;s orders, very strict.&nbsp; Our
host&rsquo;s cigar!&nbsp; We did not know they made such cigars
in this workaday world.&nbsp; No, we really could not smoke
another.&nbsp; Well, if he will be so pressing, may we put it in
our pocket?&nbsp; The truth is, we are not used to high
smoking.&nbsp; Our hostess&rsquo;s coffee!&nbsp; Would she
confide to us her secret?&nbsp; The baby!&nbsp; We hardly trust
ourselves to speak.&nbsp; The usual baby&mdash;we have seen
it.&nbsp; As a rule, to be candid, we never could detect much
beauty in babies&mdash;have always held the usual gush about them
to be insincere.&nbsp; But this baby!&nbsp; We are almost on the
point of asking them where they got it.&nbsp; It is just the kind
we wanted for ourselves.&nbsp; Little Janet&rsquo;s recitation:
&ldquo;A Visit to the Dentist!&rdquo;&nbsp; Hitherto the amateur
reciter has not appealed to us.&nbsp; But this is genius,
surely.&nbsp; She ought to be trained for the stage.&nbsp; Her
mother does not altogether approve of the stage.&nbsp; We plead
for the stage&mdash;that it may not be deprived of such
talent.</p>
<p>Every bride is beautiful.&nbsp; Every bride looks charming in
a simple costume of&mdash;for further particulars see local
papers.&nbsp; Every marriage is a cause for universal
rejoicing.&nbsp; With our wine-glass in our hand we picture the
ideal life we know to be in store for them.&nbsp; How can it be
otherwise?&nbsp; She, the daughter of her mother.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; He&mdash;well, we all know him.&nbsp; (More
cheers.)&nbsp; Also involuntary guffaw from ill-regulated young
man at end of table, promptly suppressed.</p>
<p>We carry our make-believe even into our religion.&nbsp; We sit
in church, and in voices swelling with pride, mention to the
Almighty, at stated intervals, that we are miserable
worms&mdash;that there is no good in us.&nbsp; This sort of
thing, we gather, is expected of us; it does us no harm, and is
supposed to please.</p>
<p>We make-believe that every woman is good, that every man is
honest&mdash;until they insist on forcing us, against our will,
to observe that they are not.&nbsp; Then we become very angry
with them, and explain to them that they, being sinners, are not
folk fit to mix with us perfect people.&nbsp; Our grief, when our
rich aunt dies, is hardly to be borne.&nbsp; Drapers make
fortunes, helping us to express feebly our desolation.&nbsp; Our
only consolation is that she has gone to a better world.</p>
<p>Everybody goes to a better world when they have got all they
can out of this one.</p>
<p>We stand around the open grave and tell each other so.&nbsp;
The clergyman is so assured of it that, to save time, they have
written out the formula for him and had it printed in a little
book.&nbsp; As a child it used to surprise me&mdash;this fact
that everybody went to heaven.&nbsp; Thinking of all the people
that had died, I pictured the place overcrowded.&nbsp; Almost I
felt sorry for the Devil, nobody ever coming his way, so to
speak.&nbsp; I saw him in imagination, a lonely old gentleman,
sitting at his gate day after day, hoping against hope, muttering
to himself maybe that it hardly seemed worth while, from his
point of view, keeping the show open.&nbsp; An old nurse whom I
once took into my confidence was sure, if I continued talking in
this sort of way, that he would get me anyhow.&nbsp; I must have
been an evil-hearted youngster.&nbsp; The thought of how he would
welcome me, the only human being that he had seen for years, had
a certain fascination for me; for once in my existence I should
be made a fuss about.</p>
<p>At every public meeting the chief speaker is always &ldquo;a
jolly good fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man from Mars, reading our
newspapers, would be convinced that every Member of Parliament
was a jovial, kindly, high-hearted, generous-souled saint, with
just sufficient humanity in him to prevent the angels from
carrying him off bodily.&nbsp; Do not the entire audience, moved
by one common impulse, declare him three times running, and in
stentorian voice, to be this &ldquo;jolly good
fellow&rdquo;?&nbsp; So say all of them.&nbsp; We have always
listened with the most intense pleasure to the brilliant speech
of our friend who has just sat down.&nbsp; When you thought we
were yawning, we were drinking in his eloquence,
open-mouthed.</p>
<p>The higher one ascends in the social scale, the wider becomes
this necessary base of make-believe.&nbsp; When anything sad
happens to a very big person, the lesser people round about him
hardly care to go on living.&nbsp; Seeing that the world is
somewhat overstocked with persons of importance, and that
something or another generally is happening to them, one wonders
sometimes how it is the world continues to exist.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there occurred an illness to a certain good
and great man.&nbsp; I read in my daily paper that the whole
nation was plunged in grief.&nbsp; People dining in public
restaurants, on being told the news by the waiter, dropped their
heads upon the table and sobbed.&nbsp; Strangers, meeting in the
street, flung their arms about one another and cried like little
children.&nbsp; I was abroad at the time, but on the point of
returning home.&nbsp; I almost felt ashamed to go.&nbsp; I looked
at myself in the glass, and was shocked at my own appearance: it
was that of a man who had not been in trouble for weeks.&nbsp; I
felt that to burst upon this grief-stricken nation with a
countenance such as mine would be to add to their sorrow.&nbsp;
It was borne in upon me that I must have a shallow, egotistical
nature.&nbsp; I had had luck with a play in America, and for the
life of me I could not look grief-stricken.&nbsp; There were
moments when, if I was not keeping a watch over myself, I found
myself whistling.</p>
<p>Had it been possible I would have remained abroad till some
stroke of ill-fortune had rendered me more in tune with my
fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; But business was pressing.&nbsp; The
first man I talked to on Dover pier was a Customs House
official.&nbsp; You might have thought sorrow would have made him
indifferent to a mere matter of forty-eight cigars.&nbsp; Instead
of which, he appeared quite pleased when he found them.&nbsp; He
demanded three-and-fourpence, and chuckled when he got it.&nbsp;
On Dover platform a little girl laughed because a lady dropped a
handbox on a dog; but then children are always callous&mdash;or,
perhaps, she had not heard the news.</p>
<p>What astonished me most, however, was to find in the railway
carriage a respectable looking man reading a comic journal.&nbsp;
True, he did not laugh much: he had got decency enough for that;
but what was a grief-stricken citizen doing with a comic journal,
anyhow?&nbsp; Before I had been in London an hour I had come to
the conclusion that we English must be a people of wonderful
self-control.&nbsp; The day before, according to the newspapers,
the whole country was in serious danger of pining away and dying
of a broken heart.&nbsp; In one day the nation had pulled itself
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have cried all day,&rdquo; they had
said to themselves, &ldquo;we have cried all night.&nbsp; It does
not seem to have done much good.&nbsp; Now let us once again take
up the burden of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of them&mdash;I noticed
it in the hotel dining-room that evening&mdash;were taking quite
kindly to their food again.</p>
<p>We make believe about quite serious things.&nbsp; In war, each
country&rsquo;s soldiers are always the most courageous in the
world.&nbsp; The other country&rsquo;s soldiers are always
treacherous and tricky; that is why they sometimes win.&nbsp;
Literature is the art of make-believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all of you sit round and throw your pennies in the
cap,&rdquo; says the author, &ldquo;and I will pretend that there
lives in Bayswater a young lady named Angelina, who is the most
beautiful young lady that ever existed.&nbsp; And in Notting
Hill, we will pretend, there resides a young man named Edwin, who
is in love with Angelina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, there being sufficient pennies in the cap, the
author starts away, and pretends that Angelina thought this and
said that, and that Edwin did all sorts of wonderful
things.&nbsp; We know he is making it all up as he goes
along.&nbsp; We know he is making up just what he thinks will
please us.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, has to make-believe that
he is doing it because he cannot help it, he being an
artist.&nbsp; But we know well enough that, were we to stop
throwing the pennies into the cap, he would find out precious
soon that he could.</p>
<p>The theatrical manager bangs his drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk up! walk up!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;we are going
to pretend that Mrs. Johnson is a princess, and old man Johnson
is going to pretend to be a pirate.&nbsp; Walk up, walk up, and
be in time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Johnson, pretending to be a princess, comes out of a
wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is a castle; and old man
Johnson, pretending to be a pirate, is pushed up and down on
another wobbly thing that we agree to pretend is the ocean.&nbsp;
Mrs. Johnson pretends to be in love with him, which we know she
is not.&nbsp; And Johnson pretends to be a very terrible person;
and Mrs. Johnson pretends, till eleven o&rsquo;clock, to believe
it.&nbsp; And we pay prices, varying from a shilling to
half-a-sovereign, to sit for two hours and listen to them.</p>
<p>But as I explained at the beginning, my friend is a mad sort
of person.</p>

THE AMERICAN HUSBAND MADE ENTIRELY OF STAINED GLASS.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> glad I am not an American
husband.&nbsp; At first sight this may appear a remark
uncomplimentary to the American wife.&nbsp; It is nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; It is the other way about.&nbsp; We, in Europe, have
plenty of opportunity of judging the American wife.&nbsp; In
America you hear of the American wife, you are told stories about
the American wife, you see her portrait in the illustrated
journals.&nbsp; By searching under the heading &ldquo;Foreign
Intelligence,&rdquo; you can find out what she is doing.&nbsp;
But here in Europe we know her, meet her face to face, talk to
her, flirt with her.&nbsp; She is charming, delightful.&nbsp;
That is why I say I am glad I am not an American husband.&nbsp;
If the American husband only knew how nice was the American wife,
he would sell his business and come over here, where now and then
he could see her.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I first began to travel about Europe, I argued
to myself that America must be a deadly place to live in.&nbsp;
How sad it is, I thought to myself, to meet thus, wherever one
goes, American widows by the thousand.&nbsp; In one narrow
by-street of Dresden I calculated fourteen American mothers,
possessing nine-and-twenty American children, and not a father
among them&mdash;not a single husband among the whole
fourteen.&nbsp; I pictured fourteen lonely graves, scattered over
the United States.&nbsp; I saw as in a vision those fourteen
head-stones of best material, hand-carved, recording the virtues
of those fourteen dead and buried husbands.</p>
<p>Odd, thought I to myself, decidedly odd.&nbsp; These American
husbands, they must be a delicate type of humanity.&nbsp; The
wonder is their mothers ever reared them.&nbsp; They marry fine
girls, the majority of them; two or three sweet children are born
to them, and after that there appears to be no further use for
them, as far as this world is concerned.&nbsp; Can nothing be
done to strengthen their constitutions?&nbsp; Would a tonic be of
any help to them?&nbsp; Not the customary tonic, I don&rsquo;t
mean, the sort of tonic merely intended to make gouty old
gentlemen feel they want to buy a hoop, but the sort of tonic for
which it was claimed that three drops poured upon a ham sandwich
and the thing would begin to squeak.</p>
<p>It struck me as pathetic, the picture of these American widows
leaving their native land, coming over in shiploads to spend the
rest of their blighted lives in exile.&nbsp; The mere thought of
America, I took it, had for ever become to them
distasteful.&nbsp; The ground that once his feet had
pressed!&nbsp; The old familiar places once lighted by his
smile!&nbsp; Everything in America would remind them of
him.&nbsp; Snatching their babes to their heaving bosoms they
would leave the country where lay buried all the joy of their
lives, seek in the retirement of Paris, Florence or Vienna,
oblivion of the past.</p>
<p>Also, it struck me as beautiful, the noble resignation with
which they bore their grief, hiding their sorrow from the
indifferent stranger.&nbsp; Some widows make a fuss, go about for
weeks looking gloomy and depressed, making not the slightest
effort to be merry.&nbsp; These fourteen widows&mdash;I knew them
personally, all of them, I lived in the same street&mdash;what a
brave show of cheerfulness they put on!&nbsp; What a lesson to
the common or European widow, the humpy type of widow!&nbsp; One
could spend whole days in their company&mdash;I had done
it&mdash;commencing quite early in the morning with a sleighing
excursion, finishing up quite late in the evening with a little
supper party, followed by an impromptu dance; and never detect
from their outward manner that they were not thoroughly enjoying
themselves.</p>
<p>From the mothers I turned my admiring eyes towards the
children.&nbsp; This is the secret of American success, said I to
myself; this high-spirited courage, this Spartan contempt for
suffering.&nbsp; Look at them! the gallant little men and
women.&nbsp; Who would think that they had lost a father?&nbsp;
Why, I have seen a British child more upset at losing
sixpence.</p>
<p>Talking to a little girl one day, I enquired of her concerning
the health of her father.&nbsp; The next moment I could have
bitten my tongue out, remembering that there wasn&rsquo;t such a
thing as a father&mdash;not an American father&mdash;in the whole
street.&nbsp; She did not burst into tears as they do in the
story-books.&nbsp; She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is quite well, thank you,&rdquo; simply,
pathetically, just like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; I replied with fervour,
&ldquo;well and happy as he deserves to be, and one day you will
find him again; you will go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she answered, a shining light, it
seemed to me, upon her fair young face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Momma says
she is getting just a bit tired of this one-horse sort of
place.&nbsp; She is quite looking forward to seeing him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It touched me very deeply: this weary woman, tired of her long
bereavement, actually looking forward to the fearsome passage
leading to where her loved one waited for her in a better
land.</p>
<p>For one bright breezy creature I grew to feel a real
regard.&nbsp; All the months that I had known her, seen her
almost daily, never once had I heard a single cry of pain escape
her lips, never once had I heard her cursing fate.&nbsp; Of the
many who called upon her in her charming flat, not one had ever,
to my knowledge, offered her consolation or condolence.&nbsp; It
seemed to me cruel, callous.&nbsp; The over-burdened heart,
finding no outlet for its imprisoned grief, finding no
sympathetic ear into which to pour its tale of woe, breaks, we
are told; anyhow, it isn&rsquo;t good for it.&nbsp; I
decided&mdash;no one else seeming keen&mdash;that I would supply
that sympathetic ear.&nbsp; The very next time I found myself
alone with her I introduced the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been living here in Dresden a long time, have
you not?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five years,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;on and
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all alone,&rdquo; I commented, with a sigh intended
to invite to confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly alone,&rdquo; she corrected me, while a
look of patient resignation added dignity to her piquant
features.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, there are the dear children
always round about me, during the holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;the people here are
real kind to me; they hardly ever let me feel myself alone.&nbsp;
We make up little parties, you know, picnics and
excursions.&nbsp; And then, of course, there is the Opera and the
Symphony Concerts, and the subscription dances.&nbsp; The dear
old king has been doing a good deal this winter, too; and I must
say the Embassy folks have been most thoughtful, so far as I am
concerned.&nbsp; No, it would not be right for me to complain of
loneliness, not now that I have got to know a few people, as it
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you miss your husband?&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>A cloud passed over her usually sunny face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
please don&rsquo;t talk of him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it makes
me feel real sad, thinking about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But having commenced, I was determined that my sympathy should
not be left to waste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he die of?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She gave me a look the pathos of which I shall never
forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, young man,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are you trying
to break it to me gently?&nbsp; Because if so, I&rsquo;d rather
you told me straight out.&nbsp; What did he die of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then isn&rsquo;t he dead?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;I mean
so far as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard a word about his being dead till you
started the idea,&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;So far as I
know he&rsquo;s alive and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I was sorry.&nbsp; I went on to explain that I did
not mean I was sorry to hear that in all probability he was alive
and well.&nbsp; What I meant was I was sorry I had introduced a
painful subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a painful subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your husband,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you call him a painful
subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had an idea she was getting angry with me.&nbsp; She did not
say so.&nbsp; I gathered it.&nbsp; But I had to explain myself
somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I take it, you
didn&rsquo;t get on well together, and I am sure it must have
been his fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
breathe a word against my husband or we shall quarrel.&nbsp; A
nicer, dearer fellow never lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you divorce him for?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; It was impertinent, it was unjustifiable.&nbsp; My
excuse is that the mystery surrounding the American husband had
been worrying me for months.&nbsp; Here had I stumbled upon the
opportunity of solving it.&nbsp; Instinctively I clung to my
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been any divorce,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t going to be any
divorce.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll make me cross in another
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I was becoming reckless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not
dead.&nbsp; You are not divorced from him.&nbsp; Where is
he?&rdquo; I demanded with some heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she replied, astonished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where should he be?&nbsp; At home, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked around the luxuriously-furnished room with its air of
cosy comfort, of substantial restfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What home?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What home!&nbsp; Why, our home, in Detroit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing there?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had become so
much in earnest that my voice had assumed unconsciously an
authoritative tone.&nbsp; Presumably, it hypnotised her, for she
answered my questions as though she had been in the
witness-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&nbsp; How can I possibly tell you what
he is doing?&nbsp; What do people usually do at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the questions, madam, don&rsquo;t ask
them.&nbsp; What are you doing here?&nbsp; Quite truthfully, if
you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; My eyes were fixed upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoying myself.&nbsp; He likes me to enjoy
myself.&nbsp; Besides, I am educating the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they are here at boarding-school while you are
gadding about.&nbsp; What is wrong with American education?&nbsp;
When did you see your husband last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last?&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; No, last Christmas I was
in Berlin.&nbsp; It must have been the Christmas before, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is the dear kind fellow you say he is, how is it
you haven&rsquo;t seen him for two years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, as I tell you, he is at home, in
Detroit.&nbsp; How can I see him when I am here in Dresden and he
is in Detroit?&nbsp; You do ask foolish questions.&nbsp; He means
to try and come over in the summer, if he can spare the time, and
then, of course&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer my questions, please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve spoken to
you once about it.&nbsp; Do you think you are performing your
duty as a wife, enjoying yourself in Dresden and Berlin while
your husband is working hard in Detroit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was quite willing for me to come.&nbsp; The American
husband is a good fellow who likes his wife to enjoy
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not asking for your views on the American
husband.&nbsp; I am asking your views on the American
wife&mdash;on yourself.&nbsp; The American husband appears to be
a sort of stained-glass saint, and you American wives are
imposing upon him.&nbsp; It is doing you no good, and it
won&rsquo;t go on for ever.&nbsp; There will come a day when the
American husband will wake up to the fact he is making a fool of
himself, and by over-indulgence, over-devotion, turning the
American woman into a heartless, selfish creature.&nbsp; What
sort of a home do you think it is in Detroit, with you and the
children over here?&nbsp; Tell me, is the American husband made
entirely of driven snow, with blood distilled from moonbeams, or
is he composed of the ordinary ingredients?&nbsp; Because, if the
latter, you take my advice and get back home.&nbsp; I take it
that in America, proper, there are millions of real homes where
the woman does her duty and plays the game.&nbsp; But also it is
quite clear there are thousands of homes in America, mere echoing
rooms, where the man walks by himself, his wife and children
scattered over Europe.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t going to work, it
isn&rsquo;t right that it should work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the advice of a sincere friend.&nbsp; Pack
up&mdash;you and the children&mdash;and get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left.&nbsp; It was growing late.&nbsp; I felt it was time to
leave.&nbsp; Whether she took my counsel I cannot say.&nbsp; I
only know that there still remain in Europe a goodly number of
American wives to whom it is applicable.</p>
<h2><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>DOES
THE YOUNG MAN KNOW EVERYTHING WORTH KNOWING?</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> told that American professors
are &ldquo;mourning the lack of ideals&rdquo; at Columbia
University&mdash;possibly also at other universities scattered
through the United States.&nbsp; If it be any consolation to
these mourning American professors, I can assure them that they
do not mourn alone.&nbsp; I live not far from Oxford, and enjoy
the advantage of occasionally listening to the jeremiads of
English University professors.&nbsp; More than once a German
professor has done me the honour to employ me as an object on
which to sharpen his English.&nbsp; He also has mourned similar
lack of ideals at Heidelberg, at Bonn.&nbsp; Youth is youth all
the world over; it has its own ideals; they are not those of the
University professor.&nbsp; The explanation is tolerably
simple.&nbsp; Youth is young, and the University professor,
generally speaking, is middle-aged.</p>
<p>I can sympathise with the mourning professor.&nbsp; I, in my
time, have suffered like despair.&nbsp; I remember the day so
well; it was my twelfth birthday.&nbsp; I recall the unholy joy
with which I reflected that for the future my unfortunate parents
would be called upon to pay for me full railway fare; it marked a
decided step towards manhood.&nbsp; I was now in my teens.&nbsp;
That very afternoon there came to visit us a relative of
ours.&nbsp; She brought with her three small children: a girl,
aged six; a precious, golden-haired thing in a lace collar that
called itself a boy, aged five; and a third still smaller
creature, it might have been male, it might have been female; I
could not have told you at the time, I cannot tell you now.&nbsp;
This collection of atoms was handed over to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, show yourself a man,&rdquo; said my dear mother,
&ldquo;remember you are in your teens.&nbsp; Take them out for a
walk and amuse them; and mind nothing happens to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the children themselves their own mother gave instructions
that they were to do everything that I told them, and not to tear
their clothes or make themselves untidy.&nbsp; These directions,
even to myself, at the time, appeared contradictory.&nbsp; But I
said nothing.&nbsp; And out into the wilds the four of us
departed.</p>
<p>I was an only child.&nbsp; My own infancy had passed from my
memory.&nbsp; To me, at twelve, the ideas of six were as
incomprehensible as are those of twenty to the University
professor of forty.&nbsp; I wanted to be a pirate.&nbsp; Round
the corner and across the road building operations were in
progress.&nbsp; Planks and poles lay ready to one&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Nature, in the neighbourhood, had placed conveniently
a shallow pond.&nbsp; It was Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; The
nearest public-house was a mile away.&nbsp; Immunity from
interference by the British workman was thus assured.&nbsp; It
occurred to me that by placing my three depressed looking
relatives on one raft, attacking them myself from another, taking
the eldest girl&rsquo;s sixpence away from her, disabling their
raft, and leaving them to drift without a rudder, innocent
amusement would be provided for half an hour at least.</p>
<p>They did not want to play at pirates.&nbsp; At first sight of
the pond the thing that called itself a boy began to cry.&nbsp;
The six-year-old lady said she did not like the smell of
it.&nbsp; Not even after I had explained the game to them were
they any the more enthusiastic for it.</p>
<p>I proposed Red Indians.&nbsp; They could go to sleep in the
unfinished building upon a sack of lime, I would creep up through
the grass, set fire to the house, and dance round it, whooping
and waving my tomahawk, watching with fiendish delight the
frantic but futile efforts of the palefaces to escape their
doom.</p>
<p>It did not &ldquo;catch on&rdquo;&mdash;not even that.&nbsp;
The precious thing in the lace collar began to cry again.&nbsp;
The creature concerning whom I could not have told you whether it
was male or female made no attempt at argument, but started to
run; it seemed to have taken a dislike to this particular
field.&nbsp; It stumbled over a scaffolding pole, and then it
also began to cry.&nbsp; What could one do to amuse such
people?&nbsp; I left it to them to propose something.&nbsp; They
thought they would like to play at
&ldquo;Mothers&rdquo;&mdash;not in this field, but in some other
field.</p>
<p>The eldest girl would be mother.&nbsp; The other two would
represent her children.&nbsp; They had been taken suddenly
ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Waterworks,&rdquo; as I had christened him, was
to hold his hands to his middle and groan.&nbsp; His face
brightened up at the suggestion.&nbsp; The nondescript had the
toothache.&nbsp; It took up its part without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, and set to work to scream.&nbsp; I could be the
doctor and look at their tongues.</p>
<p>That was their &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; game.&nbsp; As I have said,
remembering that afternoon, I can sympathise with the University
professor mourning the absence of University ideals in
youth.&nbsp; Possibly at six my own ideal game may have been
&ldquo;Mothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Looking back from the pile of
birthdays upon which I now stand, it occurs to me that very
probably it was.&nbsp; But from the perspective of twelve, the
reflection that there were beings in the world who could find
recreation in such fooling saddened me.</p>
<p>Eight years later, his father not being able to afford the
time, I conducted Master &ldquo;Waterworks,&rdquo; now a healthy,
uninteresting, gawky lad, to a school in Switzerland.&nbsp; It
was my first Continental trip.&nbsp; I should have enjoyed it
better had he not been with me.&nbsp; He thought Paris a
&ldquo;beastly hole.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not share my admiration
for the Frenchwoman; he even thought her badly dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she&rsquo;s so tied up, she can&rsquo;t walk
straight,&rdquo; was the only impression she left upon him.</p>
<p>We changed the subject; it irritated me to hear him
talk.&nbsp; The beautiful Juno-like creatures we came across
further on in Germany, he said were too fat.&nbsp; He wanted to
see them run.&nbsp; I found him utterly soulless.</p>
<p>To expect a boy to love learning and culture is like expecting
him to prefer old vintage claret to gooseberry wine.&nbsp;
Culture for the majority is an acquired taste.&nbsp; Speaking
personally, I am entirely in agreement with the University
professor.&nbsp; I find knowledge, prompting to observation and
leading to reflection, the most satisfactory luggage with which a
traveller through life can provide himself.&nbsp; I would that I
had more of it.&nbsp; To be able to enjoy a picture is of more
advantage than to be able to buy it.</p>
<p>All that the University professor can urge in favour of
idealism I am prepared to endorse.&nbsp; But then I am&mdash;let
us say, thirty-nine.&nbsp; At fourteen my candid opinion was that
he was talking &ldquo;rot.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at the old
gentleman himself&mdash;a narrow-chested, spectacled old
gentleman, who lived up a by street.&nbsp; He did not seem to
have much fun of any sort.&nbsp; It was not my ideal.&nbsp; He
told me things had been written in a language called Greek that I
should enjoy reading, but I had not even read all Captain
Marryat.&nbsp; There were tales by Sir Walter Scott and
&ldquo;Jack Harkaway&rsquo;s Schooldays!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt I
could wait a while.&nbsp; There was a chap called Aristophanes
who had written comedies, satirising the political institutions
of a country that had disappeared two thousand years ago.&nbsp; I
say, without shame, Drury Lane pantomime and Barnum&rsquo;s
Circus called to me more strongly.</p>
<p>Wishing to give the old gentleman a chance, I dipped into
translations.&nbsp; Some of these old fellows were not as bad as
I had imagined them.&nbsp; A party named Homer had written some
really interesting stuff.&nbsp; Here and there, maybe, he was a
bit long-winded, but, taking him as a whole, there was
&ldquo;go&rdquo; in him.&nbsp; There was another of
them&mdash;Ovid was his name.&nbsp; He could tell a story, Ovid
could.&nbsp; He had imagination.&nbsp; He was almost as good as
&ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought it would please my
professor, telling him that I was reading these, his favourite
authors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading them!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but you
don&rsquo;t know Greek or Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know English,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;they have
all been translated into English.&nbsp; You never told me
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared it was not the same thing.&nbsp; There were subtle
delicacies of diction bound to escape even the best
translator.&nbsp; These subtle delicacies of diction I could
enjoy only by devoting the next seven or eight years of my life
to the study of Greek and Latin.&nbsp; It will grieve the
University professor to hear it, but the enjoyment of those
subtle delicacies of diction did not appear to me&mdash;I was
only fourteen at the time, please remember&mdash;to be worth the
time and trouble.</p>
<p>The boy is materially inclined&mdash;the mourning American
professor has discovered it.&nbsp; I did not want to be an
idealist living up a back street.&nbsp; I wanted to live in the
biggest house in the best street of the town.&nbsp; I wanted to
ride a horse, wear a fur coat, and have as much to eat and drink
as ever I liked.&nbsp; I wanted to marry the most beautiful woman
in the world, to have my name in the newspaper, and to know that
everybody was envying me.</p>
<p>Mourn over it, my dear professor, as you will&mdash;that is
the ideal of youth; and, so long as human nature remains what it
is, will continue to be so.&nbsp; It is a materialistic
ideal&mdash;a sordid ideal.&nbsp; Maybe it is necessary.&nbsp;
Maybe the world would not move much if the young men started
thinking too early.&nbsp; They want to be rich, so they fling
themselves frenziedly into the struggle.&nbsp; They build the
towns, and make the railway tracks, hew down the forests, dig the
ore out of the ground.&nbsp; There comes a day when it is borne
in upon them that trying to get rich is a poor sort of
game&mdash;that there is only one thing more tiresome than being
a millionaire, and that is trying to be a millionaire.&nbsp; But,
meanwhile, the world has got its work done.</p>
<p>The American professor fears that the artistic development of
America leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; I fear the artistic
development of most countries leaves much to be desired.&nbsp;
Why the Athenians themselves sandwiched their drama between
wrestling competitions and boxing bouts.&nbsp; The plays of
Sophocles, or Euripides, were given as &ldquo;side
shows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chief items of the fair were the games
and races.&nbsp; Besides, America is still a young man.&nbsp; It
has been busy &ldquo;getting on in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has
not yet quite finished.&nbsp; Yet there are signs that young
America is approaching the thirty-nines.&nbsp; He is finding a
little time, a little money to spare for art.&nbsp; One can
almost hear young America&mdash;not quite so young as he
was&mdash;saying to Mrs. Europe as he enters and closes the shop
door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, here I am, and maybe you&rsquo;ll be
glad to hear I&rsquo;ve a little money to spend.&nbsp; Yes,
ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve fixed things all right across the water;
we shan&rsquo;t starve.&nbsp; So now, ma&rsquo;am, you and I can
have a chat concerning this art I&rsquo;ve been hearing so much
about.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have a look at it, ma&rsquo;am, trot it
out, and don&rsquo;t you be afraid of putting a fair price upon
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that Mrs. Europe has not hesitated to
put a good price upon the art she has sold to Uncle Sam.&nbsp; I
am afraid Mrs. Europe has occasionally &ldquo;unloaded&rdquo; on
Uncle Sam.&nbsp; I talked to a certain dealer one afternoon, now
many years ago, at the Uwantit Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the next picture likely to be missing?&rdquo; I
asked him in the course of general conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thome little thing of Hoppner&rsquo;th, if it mutht
be,&rdquo; he replied with confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoppner,&rdquo; I murmured, &ldquo;I seem to have heard
the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth; you&rsquo;ll hear it a bit oftener during the
next eighteen month or tho.&nbsp; You take care you don&rsquo;t
get tired of hearing it, thath all,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yeth,&rdquo; he continued, thoughtfully, &ldquo;Reynoldth
ith played out.&nbsp; Nothing much to be made of Gainthborough,
either.&nbsp; Dealing in that lot now, why, it&rsquo;th like
keeping a potht offith.&nbsp; Hoppner&rsquo;th the coming
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been buying Hoppners up cheap,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between uth,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;yeth, I think
we&rsquo;ve got them all.&nbsp; Maybe a few more.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve mithed any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sell them for more than you gave for
them,&rdquo; I hinted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thmart,&rdquo; he answered, regarding me
admiringly, &ldquo;you thee through everything you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you work it?&rdquo; I asked him.&nbsp; There is
a time in the day when he is confidential.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
this man, Hoppner.&nbsp; I take it that you have bought him up at
an average of a hundred pounds a picture, and that at that price
most owners were fairly glad to sell.&nbsp; Few folks outside the
art schools have ever heard of him.&nbsp; I bet that at the
present moment there isn&rsquo;t one art critic who could spell
his name without reference to a dictionary.&nbsp; In eighteen
months you will be selling him for anything from one thousand to
ten thousand pounds.&nbsp; How is it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ith everything done that&rsquo;th done well?&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;By earnetht effort.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
hitched his chair nearer to me, &ldquo;I get a chap&mdash;one of
your thort of chapth&mdash;he writ&rsquo;th an article about
Hoppner.&nbsp; I get another to anthwer him.&nbsp; Before
I&rsquo;ve done there&rsquo;ll be a hundred articleth about
Hoppner&mdash;hith life, hith early thruggie, anecdo&rsquo;th
about hith wife.&nbsp; Then a Hoppner will be thold at public
auchtion for a thouthand guineath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you be certain it will fetch a thousand
guineas?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know the man whoth going to buy
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He winked, and I understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortnight later there will be a thale of
half-a-dothen, and the prithe will be gone up by that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; he replied, rising, &ldquo;the
American millionaire!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll jutht be waiting on the
door-thtep for the thale-room to open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If by any chance I come across a Hoppner?&rdquo; I
said, laughing, as I turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hold on to it too long, that&rsquo;th
all,&rdquo; was his advice.</p>
<h2><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>HOW
MANY CHARMS HATH MUSIC, WOULD YOU SAY?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> argument of the late Herr
Wagner was that grand opera&mdash;the music drama, as he called
it&mdash;included, and therefore did away with the necessity
for&mdash;all other arts.&nbsp; Music in all its branches, of
course, it provides: so much I will concede to the late Herr
Wagner.&nbsp; There are times, I confess, when my musical
yearnings might shock the late Herr Wagner&mdash;times when I
feel unequal to following three distinct themes at one and the
same instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispers the Wagnerian enthusiast to me,
&ldquo;the cornet has now the Brunnhilda motive.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
seems to me, in my then state of depravity, as if the cornet had
even more than this the matter with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second violins,&rdquo; continues the Wagnerian
enthusiast, &ldquo;are carrying on the Wotan theme.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That they are carrying on goes without saying: the players&rsquo;
faces are streaming with perspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brass,&rdquo; explains my friend&mdash;his object
is to cultivate my ear&mdash;&ldquo;is accompanying the
singers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should have said drowning them.&nbsp;
There are occasions when I can rave about Wagner with the best of
them.&nbsp; High class moods come to all of us.&nbsp; The
difference between the really high-class man and us commonplace,
workaday men is the difference between, say, the eagle and the
barnyard chicken.&nbsp; I am the barnyard chicken.&nbsp; I have
my wings.&nbsp; There are ecstatic moments when I feel I want to
spurn the sordid earth and soar into the realms of art.&nbsp; I
do fly a little, but my body is heavy, and I only get as far as
the fence.&nbsp; After a while I find it lonesome on the fence,
and I hop down again among my fellows.</p>
<p>Listening to Wagner, during such temporary Philistinic mood,
my sense of fair play is outraged.&nbsp; A lone, lorn woman
stands upon the stage trying to make herself heard.&nbsp; She has
to do this sort of thing for her living; maybe an invalid mother,
younger brothers and sisters are dependent upon her.&nbsp; One
hundred and forty men, all armed with powerful instruments,
well-organised, and most of them looking well-fed, combine to
make it impossible for a single note of that poor woman&rsquo;s
voice to be heard above their din.&nbsp; I see her standing
there, opening and shutting her mouth, getting redder and redder
in the face.&nbsp; She is singing, one feels sure of it; one
could hear her if only those one hundred and forty men would ease
up for a minute.&nbsp; She makes one mighty, supreme effort;
above the banging of the drums, the blare of the trumpets, the
shrieking of the strings, that last despairing note is distinctly
heard.</p>
<p>She has won, but the victory has cost her dear.&nbsp; She
sinks down fainting on the stage and is carried off by
supers.&nbsp; Chivalrous indignation has made it difficult for me
to keep my seat watching the unequal contest.&nbsp; My instinct
was to leap the barrier, hurl the bald-headed chief of her
enemies from his high chair, and lay about me with the trombone
or the clarionet&mdash;whichever might have come the easier to my
snatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cowardly lot of bullies,&rdquo; I have wanted to
cry, &ldquo;are you not ashamed of yourselves?&nbsp; A hundred
and forty of you against one, and that one a still beautiful and,
comparatively speaking, young lady.&nbsp; Be quiet for a
minute&mdash;can&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Give the poor girl a
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lady of my acquaintance says that sitting out a Wagnerian
opera seems to her like listening to a singer accompanied by four
orchestras playing different tunes at the same time.&nbsp; As I
have said, there are times when Wagner carries me along with him,
when I exult in the crash and whirl of his contending
harmonies.&nbsp; But, alas! there are those other
moods&mdash;those after dinner moods&mdash;when my desire is for
something distinctly resembling a tune.&nbsp; Still, there are
other composers of grand opera besides Wagner.&nbsp; I grant to
the late Herr Wagner, that, in so far as music is concerned,
opera can supply us with all we can need.</p>
<p>But it was also Wagner&rsquo;s argument that grand opera could
supply us with acting, and there I am compelled to disagree with
him.&nbsp; Wagner thought that the arts of acting and singing
could be combined.&nbsp; I have seen artists the great man has
trained himself.&nbsp; As singers they left nothing to be
desired, but the acting in grand opera has never yet impressed
me.&nbsp; Wagner never succeeded in avoiding the operatic
convention and nobody else ever will.&nbsp; When the operatic
lover meets his sweetheart he puts her in a corner and, turning
his back upon her, comes down to the footlights and tells the
audience how he adores her.&nbsp; When he has finished, he, in
his turn, retires into the corner, and she comes down and tells
the audience that she is simply mad about him.</p>
<p>Overcome with joy at finding she really cares for him, he
comes down right and says that this is the happiest moment of his
life; and she stands left, twelve feet away from him, and has the
presentiment that all this sort of thing is much too good to
last.&nbsp; They go off together, backwards, side by side.&nbsp;
If there is any love-making, such as I understand by the term, it
is done &ldquo;off.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is not my idea of
acting.&nbsp; But I do not see how you are going to substitute
for it anything more natural.&nbsp; When you are singing at the
top of your voice, you don&rsquo;t want a heavy woman hanging
round your neck.&nbsp; When you are killing a man and warbling
about it at the same time, you don&rsquo;t want him fooling
around you defending himself.&nbsp; You want him to have a little
reasonable patience, and to wait in his proper place till you
have finished, telling him, or rather telling the crowd, how much
you hate and despise him.</p>
<p>When the proper time comes, and if he is where you expect to
find him while thinking of your upper C, you will hit him lightly
on the shoulder with your sword, and then he can die to his own
particular tune.&nbsp; If you have been severely wounded in
battle, or in any other sort of row, and have got to sing a long
ballad before you finally expire, you don&rsquo;t want to have to
think how a man would really behave who knew he had only got a
few minutes to live and was feeling bad about it.&nbsp; The
chances are that he would not want to sing at all.&nbsp; The
woman who really loved him would not encourage him to sing.&nbsp;
She would want him to keep quiet while she moved herself about a
bit, in case there was anything that could be done for him.</p>
<p>If a mob is climbing the stairs thirsting for your blood, you
do not want to stand upright with your arms stretched out, a good
eighteen inches from the door, while you go over at some length
the varied incidents leading up to the annoyance.&nbsp; If your
desire were to act naturally you would push against that door for
all you were worth, and yell for somebody to bring you a chest of
drawers and a bedstead, and things like that, to pile up against
it.&nbsp; If you were a king, and were giving a party, you would
not want your guests to fix you up at the other end of the room
and leave you there, with nobody to talk to but your own wife,
while they turned their backs upon you, and had a long and
complicated dance all to themselves.&nbsp; You would want to be
in it; you would want to let them know that you were king.</p>
<p>In acting, all these little points have to be
considered.&nbsp; In opera, everything is rightly sacrificed to
musical necessity.&nbsp; I have seen the young, enthusiastic
opera-singer who thought that he or she could act and sing at the
same time.&nbsp; The experienced artist takes the centre of the
stage and husbands his resources.&nbsp; Whether he is supposed to
be indignant because somebody has killed his mother, or cheerful
because he is going out to fight his country&rsquo;s foes, who
are only waiting until he has finished singing to attack the
town, he leaves it to the composer to make clear.</p>
<p>Also it was Herr Wagner&rsquo;s idea that the back cloth would
leave the opera-goer indifferent to the picture gallery.&nbsp;
The castle on the rock, accessible only by balloon, in which
every window lights up simultaneously and instantaneously, one
minute after sunset, while the full moon is rushing up the sky at
the pace of a champion comet&mdash;that wonderful sea that
suddenly opens and swallows up the ship&mdash;those snow-clad
mountains, over which the shadow of the hero passes like a
threatening cloud&mdash;the grand old chateau, trembling in the
wind&mdash;what need, will ask the opera-goer of the future, of
your Turners and your Corots, when, for prices ranging from a
shilling upwards, we can have a dozen pictures such as these
rolled up and down before us every evening?</p>
<p>But perhaps the most daring hope of all was the dream that
came to Herr Wagner that his opera singers, his grouped choruses,
would eventually satisfy the craving of the public for high class
statuary.&nbsp; I am not quite sure the general public does care
for statuary.&nbsp; I do not know whether the idea has ever
occurred to the Anarchist, but, were I myself organising secret
committee meetings for unholy purposes, I should invite my
comrades to meet in that section of the local museum devoted to
statuary.&nbsp; I can conceive of no place where we should be
freer from prying eyes and listening ears.&nbsp; A select few,
however, do appreciate statuary; and such, I am inclined to
think, will not be weaned from their passion by the contemplation
of the opera singer in his or her various quaint costumes.</p>
<p>And even if the tenor always satisfied our ideal of Apollo,
and the soprano were always as sylph-like as she is described in
the libretto, even then I should doubt the average operatic
chorus being regarded by the <i>connoisseur</i> as a cheap and
pleasant substitute for a bas relief from the Elgin
marbles.&nbsp; The great thing required of that operatic chorus
is experience.&nbsp; The young and giddy-pated the chorus master
has no use for.&nbsp; The sober, honest, industrious lady or
gentleman, with a knowledge of music is very properly his
ideal.</p>
<p>What I admire about the chorus chiefly is its unity.&nbsp; The
whole village dresses exactly alike.&nbsp; In wicked, worldly
villages there is rivalry, leading to heartburn and
jealously.&nbsp; One lady comes out suddenly, on, say, a Bank
Holiday, in a fetching blue that conquers every male heart.&nbsp;
Next holiday her rival cuts her out with a green hat.&nbsp; In
the operatic village it must be that the girls gather together
beforehand to arrange this thing.&nbsp; There is probably a
meeting called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear Count&rsquo;s wedding,&rdquo; announces the
chairwoman, &ldquo;you will all be pleased to hear, has been
fixed for the fourteenth, at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; The entire village will be assembled at ten-thirty
to await the return of the bridal <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> from the
church, and offer its felicitations.&nbsp; Married ladies, will,
of course, come accompanied by their husbands.&nbsp; Unmarried
ladies must each bring a male partner as near their own height as
possible.&nbsp; Fortunately, in this village the number of males
is exactly equal to that of females, so that the picture need not
be spoiled.&nbsp; The children will organise themselves into an
independent body and will group themselves picturesquely.&nbsp;
It has been thought advisable,&rdquo; continues the chairwoman,
&ldquo;that the village should meet the dear Count and his bride
at some spot not too far removed from the local alehouse.&nbsp;
The costume to be worn by the ladies will consist of a short pink
skirt terminating at the knees and ornamented with festoons of
flowers; above will be worn a bolero in mauve silk without
sleeves and cut <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; The shoes
should be of yellow satin over flesh-coloured stockings.&nbsp;
Ladies who are &lsquo;out&rsquo; will wear pearl necklaces, and a
simple device in emeralds to decorate the hair.&nbsp; Thank God,
we can all of us afford it, and provided the weather holds up and
nothing unexpected happens&mdash;he is not what I call a lucky
man, our Count, and it is always as well to be prepared for
possibilities&mdash;well, I think we may look forward to a really
pleasant day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot be done, Herr Wagner, believe me.&nbsp; You cannot
substitute the music drama for all the arts combined.&nbsp; The
object to be aimed at by the wise composer should be to make us,
while listening to his music, forgetful of all remaining artistic
considerations.</p>
<h2><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>THE
WHITE MAN&rsquo;S BURDEN!&nbsp; NEED IT BE SO HEAVY?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a delightful stroll on a
sunny summer morning from the Hague to the Huis ten Bosch, the
little &ldquo;house in the wood,&rdquo; built for Princess
Amalia, widow of Stadtholter Frederick Henry, under whom Holland
escaped finally from the bondage of her foes and entered into the
promised land of Liberty.&nbsp; Leaving the quiet streets, the
tree-bordered canals, with their creeping barges, you pass
through a pleasant park, where the soft-eyed deer press round
you, hurt and indignant if you have brought nothing in your
pocket&mdash;not even a piece of sugar&mdash;to offer them.&nbsp;
It is not that they are grasping&mdash;it is the want of
attention that wounds them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was a gentleman,&rdquo; they seem to be
saying to one another, if you glance back, &ldquo;he looked like
a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their mild eyes haunt you; on the next occasion you do not
forget.&nbsp; The Park merges into the forest; you go by winding
ways till you reach the trim Dutch garden, moat-encircled, in the
centre of which stands the prim old-fashioned villa, which, to
the simple Dutchman, appears a palace.&nbsp; The
<i>concierge</i>, an old soldier, bows low to you and introduces
you to his wife&mdash;a stately, white-haired dame, who talks
most languages a little, so far as relates to all things within
and appertaining to this tiny palace of the wood.&nbsp; To things
without, beyond the wood, her powers of conversation do not
extend: apparently such matters do not interest her.</p>
<p>She conducts you to the Chinese Room; the sun streams through
the windows, illuminating the wondrous golden dragons standing
out in bold relief from the burnished lacquer work, decorating
still further with light and shade the delicate silk embroideries
thin taper hands have woven with infinite pains.&nbsp; The walls
are hung with rice paper, depicting the conventional scenes of
the conventional Chinese life.</p>
<p>You find your thoughts wandering.&nbsp; These grotesque
figures, these caricatures of humanity!&nbsp; A comical creature,
surely, this Chinaman, the pantaloon of civilization.&nbsp; How
useful he has been to us for our farces, our comic operas!&nbsp;
This yellow baby, in his ample pinafore, who lived thousands of
years ago, who has now passed into this strange second
childhood.</p>
<p>But is he dying&mdash;or does the life of a nation wake again,
as after sleep?&nbsp; Is he this droll, harmless thing he here
depicts himself?&nbsp; And if not?&nbsp; Suppose fresh sap be
stirring through his three hundred millions?&nbsp; We thought he
was so very dead; we thought the time had come to cut him up and
divide him, the only danger being lest we should quarrel over his
carcase among ourselves.</p>
<p>Suppose it turns out as the fable of the woodcutter and the
bear?&nbsp; The woodcutter found the bear lying in the
forest.&nbsp; At first he was much frightened, but the bear lay
remarkably still.&nbsp; So the woodman crept nearer, ventured to
kick the bear&mdash;very gently, ready to run if need be.&nbsp;
Surely the bear was dead!&nbsp; And parts of a bear are good to
eat, and bearskin to poor woodfolk on cold winter nights is
grateful.&nbsp; So the woodman drew his knife and commenced the
necessary preliminaries.&nbsp; But the bear was not dead.</p>
<p>If the Chinaman be not dead?&nbsp; If the cutting-up process
has only served to waken him?&nbsp; In a little time from now we
shall know.</p>
<p>From the Chinese Room the white-haired dame leads us to the
Japanese Room.&nbsp; Had gentle-looking Princess Amalia some
vague foreshadowing of the future in her mind when she planned
these two rooms leading into one another?&nbsp; The Japanese
decorations are more grotesque, the designs less cheerfully
comical than those of cousin Chinaman.&nbsp; These monstrous,
mis-shapen wrestlers, these patient-looking gods, with their
inscrutable eyes!&nbsp; Was it always there, or is it only by the
light of present events that one reads into the fantastic fancies
of the artist working long ago in the doorway of his paper house,
a meaning that has hitherto escaped us?</p>
<p>But the chief attraction of the Huis ten Bosch is the gorgeous
Orange Saloon, lighted by a cupola, fifty feet above the floor,
the walls one blaze of pictures, chiefly of the gorgeous Jordaen
school&mdash;&ldquo;The Defeat of the Vices,&rdquo; &ldquo;Time
Vanquishing Slander&rdquo;&mdash;mostly allegorical, in praise of
all the virtues, in praise of enlightenment and progress.&nbsp;
Aptly enough in a room so decorated, here was held the famous
Peace Congress that closed the last century.&nbsp; One can hardly
avoid smiling as one thinks of the solemn conclave of grandees
assembled to proclaim the popularity of Peace.</p>
<p>It was in the autumn of the same year that Europe decided upon
the dividing-up of China, that soldiers were instructed by
Christian monarchs to massacre men, women and children, the idea
being to impress upon the Heathen Chinee the superior
civilization of the white man.&nbsp; The Boer war followed almost
immediately.&nbsp; Since when the white man has been pretty busy
all over the world with his &ldquo;expeditions&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;missions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world is undoubtedly growing
more refined.&nbsp; We do not care for ugly words.&nbsp; Even the
burglar refers airily to the &ldquo;little job&rdquo; he has on
hand.&nbsp; You would think he had found work in the
country.&nbsp; I should not be surprised to learn that he says a
prayer before starting, telegraphs home to his anxious wife the
next morning that his task has been crowned with blessing.</p>
<p>Until the far-off date of Universal Brotherhood war will
continue.&nbsp; Matters considered unimportant by both parties
will&mdash;with a mighty flourish of trumpets&mdash;be referred
to arbitration.&nbsp; I was talking of a famous financier a while
ago with a man who had been his secretary.&nbsp; Amongst other
anecdotes, he told me of a certain agreement about which dispute
had arisen.&nbsp; The famous financier took the paper into his
own hands and made a few swift calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;it is only a
thousand pounds at the outside.&nbsp; May as well be
honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning a dead fisherman or two, concerning boundaries
through unproductive mountain ranges we shall arbitrate and feel
virtuous.&nbsp; For gold mines and good pasture lands, mixed up
with a little honour to give respectability to the business, we
shall fight it out, as previously.&nbsp; War being thus
inevitable, the humane man will rejoice that by one of those
brilliant discoveries, so simple when they are explained, war in
the future is going to be rendered equally satisfactory to victor
and to vanquished.</p>
<p>In by-elections, as a witty writer has pointed out, there are
no defeats&mdash;only victories and moral victories.&nbsp; The
idea seems to have caught on.&nbsp; War in the future is
evidently going to be conducted on the same understanding.&nbsp;
Once upon a time, from a far-off land, a certain general
telegraphed home congratulating his Government that the enemy had
shown no inclination whatever to prevent his running away.&nbsp;
The whole country rejoiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they never even tried to stop him,&rdquo;
citizens, meeting other citizens in the street, told each
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, they&rsquo;ve had enough of him.&nbsp; I
bet they are only too glad to get rid of him.&nbsp; Why, they say
he ran for miles without seeing a trace of the foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enemy&rsquo;s general, on the other hand, also wrote home
congratulating his Government.&nbsp; In this way the same battle
can be mafficked over by both parties.&nbsp; Contentment is the
great secret of happiness.&nbsp; Everything happens for the best,
if only you look at it the right way.&nbsp; That is going to be
the argument.&nbsp; The general of the future will telegraph to
headquarters that he is pleased to be able to inform His Majesty
that the enemy, having broken down all opposition, has succeeded
in crossing the frontier and is now well on his way to His
Majesty&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am luring him on,&rdquo; he will add, &ldquo;as fast
as I can.&nbsp; At our present rate of progress, I am in hopes of
bringing him home by the tenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lest foolish civilian sort of people should wonder whereabouts
lies the cause for rejoicing, the military man will condescend to
explain.&nbsp; The enemy is being enticed farther and farther
from his base.&nbsp; The defeated general&mdash;who is not really
defeated, who is only artful, and who appears to be running away,
is not really running away at all.&nbsp; On the contrary, he is
running home&mdash;bringing, as he explains, the enemy with
him.</p>
<p>If I remember rightly&mdash;it is long since I played
it&mdash;there is a parlour game entitled &ldquo;Puss in the
Corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; You beckon another player to you with your
finger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Puss, puss!&rdquo; you cry.&nbsp; Thereupon
he has to leave his chair&mdash;his &ldquo;base,&rdquo; as the
military man would term it&mdash;and try to get to you without
anything happening to him.</p>
<p>War in the future is going to be Puss in the Corner on a
bigger scale.&nbsp; You lure your enemy away from his base.&nbsp;
If all goes well&mdash;if he does not see the trap that is being
laid for him&mdash;why, then, almost before he knows it, he finds
himself in your capital.&nbsp; That finishes the game.&nbsp; You
find out what it is he really wants.&nbsp; Provided it is
something within reason, and you happen to have it handy, you
give it to him.&nbsp; He goes home crowing, and you, on your
side, laugh when you think how cleverly you succeeded in luring
him away from his base.</p>
<p>There is a bright side to all things.&nbsp; The gentleman
charged with the defence of a fortress will meet the other
gentleman who has captured it and shake hands with him mid the
ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are at last!&rdquo; he will explain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come before?&nbsp; We have been
waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he will send off dispatches felicitating his chief on
having got that fortress off their hands, together with all the
worry and expense it has been to them.&nbsp; When prisoners are
taken you will console yourself with the reflection that the cost
of feeding them for the future will have to be borne by the
enemy.&nbsp; Captured cannon you will watch being trailed away
with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confounded heavy things!&rdquo; you will say to
yourself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank goodness I&rsquo;ve got rid of
them.&nbsp; Let him have the fun of dragging them about these
ghastly roads.&nbsp; See how he likes the job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>War is a ridiculous method of settling disputes.&nbsp;
Anything that can tend to make its ridiculous aspect more
apparent is to be welcomed.&nbsp; The new school of military
dispatch-writers may succeed in turning even the laughter of the
mob against it.</p>
<p>The present trouble in the East would never have occurred but
for the white man&rsquo;s enthusiasm for bearing other
people&rsquo;s burdens.&nbsp; What we call the yellow danger is
the fear that the yellow man may before long request us, so far
as he is concerned, to put his particular burden down.&nbsp; It
may occur to him that, seeing it is his property, he would just
as soon carry it himself.&nbsp; A London policeman told me a
story the other day that struck him as an example of Cockney
humour under trying circumstances.&nbsp; But it may also serve as
a fable.&nbsp; From a lonely street in the neighbourhood of
Covent Garden, early one morning, the constable heard cries of
&ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; shouted in a childish treble.&nbsp; He
arrived on the scene just in time to collar a young hooligan,
who, having snatched a basket of fruit from a small lad&mdash;a
greengrocer&rsquo;s errand boy, as it turned out&mdash;was, with
it, making tracks.&nbsp; The greengrocer&rsquo;s boy, between
panting and tears, delivered his accusation.&nbsp; The hooligan
regarded him with an expression of amazed indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;yer mean, stealing it?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Hooligan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I was carrying it for
yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white man has got into the way of &ldquo;carrying&rdquo;
other people&rsquo;s burdens, and now it looks as if the yellow
man were going to object to our carrying his any further.&nbsp;
Maybe he is going to get nasty, and insist on carrying it
himself.&nbsp; We call this &ldquo;the yellow danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend of mine&mdash;he is a man who in the street walks
into lamp-posts, and apologises&mdash;sees rising from the East
the dawn of a new day in the world&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; The
yellow danger is to him a golden hope.&nbsp; He sees a race long
stagnant, stretching its giant limbs with the first vague
movements of returning life.&nbsp; He is a poor sort of patriot;
he calls himself, I suppose, a white man, yet he shamelessly
confesses he would rather see Asia&rsquo;s millions rise from the
ruins of their ancient civilization to take their part in the
future of humanity, than that half the population of the globe
should remain bound in savagery for the pleasure and the profit
of his own particular species.</p>
<p>He even goes so far as to think that the white man may have
something to learn.&nbsp; The world has belonged to him now for
some thousands of years.&nbsp; Has he done all with it that could
have been done?&nbsp; Are his ideals the last word?</p>
<p>Not what the yellow man has absorbed from Europe, but what he
is going to give Europe it is that interests my friend.&nbsp; He
is watching the birth of a new force&mdash;an influence as yet
unknown.&nbsp; He clings to the fond belief that new ideas, new
formul&aelig;, to replace the old worn shibboleths, may, during
these thousands of years, have been developing in those keen
brains that behind the impressive yellow mask have been working
so long in silence and in mystery.</p>
<h2><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>WHY
DIDN&rsquo;T HE MARRY THE GIRL?</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is wrong with marriage,
anyhow?&nbsp; I find myself pondering this question so often,
when reading high-class literature.&nbsp; I put it to myself
again the other evening, during a performance of Faust.&nbsp; Why
could not Faust have married the girl?&nbsp; I would not have
married her myself for any consideration whatsoever; but that is
not the argument.&nbsp; Faust, apparently, could not see anything
amiss with her.&nbsp; Both of them were mad about each
other.&nbsp; Yet the idea of a quiet, unostentatious marriage
with a week&rsquo;s honeymoon, say, in Vienna, followed by a neat
little cottage <i>orn&eacute;</i>, not too far from
N&uuml;rnberg, so that their friends could have come out to them,
never seems to have occurred to either of them.</p>
<p>There could have been a garden.&nbsp; Marguerite might have
kept chickens and a cow.&nbsp; That sort of girl, brought up to
hard work and by no means too well educated, is all the better
for having something to do.&nbsp; Later, with the gradual arrival
of the family, a good, all-round woman might have been hired in
to assist.&nbsp; Faust, of course, would have had his study and
got to work again; that would have kept him out of further
mischief.&nbsp; The idea that a brainy man, his age, was going to
be happy with nothing to do all day but fool round a petticoat
was ridiculous from the beginning.&nbsp; Valentine&mdash;a good
fellow, Valentine, with nice ideas&mdash;would have spent his
Saturdays to Monday with them.&nbsp; Over a pipe and a glass of
wine, he and Faust would have discussed the local politics.</p>
<p>He would have danced the children on his knee, have told them
tales about the war&mdash;taught the eldest boy to shoot.&nbsp;
Faust, with a practical man like Valentine to help him, would
probably have invented a new gun.&nbsp; Valentine would have got
it taken up.</p>
<p>Things might have come of it.&nbsp; Sybil, in course of time,
would have married and settled down&mdash;perhaps have taken a
little house near to them.&nbsp; He and Marguerite would have
joked&mdash;when Mrs. Sybil was not around&mdash;about his early
infatuation.&nbsp; The old mother would have toddled over from
N&uuml;rnberg&mdash;not too often, just for the day.</p>
<p>The picture grows upon one the more one thinks of it.&nbsp;
Why did it never occur to them?&nbsp; There would have been a bit
of a bother with the Old Man.&nbsp; I can imagine Mephistopheles
being upset about it, thinking himself swindled.&nbsp; Of course,
if that was the reason&mdash;if Faust said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to marry the girl, but I won&rsquo;t do
it; it would not be fair to the Old Man; he has been to a lot of
trouble working this thing up; in common gratitude I cannot turn
round now and behave like a decent, sensible man; it would not be
playing the game&rdquo;&mdash;if this was the way Faust looked at
the matter there is nothing more to be said.&nbsp; Indeed, it
shows him in rather a fine light&mdash;noble, if quixotic.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, he looked at the question from the
point of view of himself and the girl, I think the thing might
have been managed.&nbsp; All one had to do in those days when one
wanted to get rid of the Devil was to show him a sword
hilt.&nbsp; Faust and Marguerite could have slipped into a church
one morning, and have kept him out of the way with a sword hilt
till the ceremony was through.&nbsp; They might have hired a
small boy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the gentleman in red?&nbsp; Well, he wants us
and we don&rsquo;t want him.&nbsp; That is the only difference
between us.&nbsp; Now, you take this sword, and when you see him
coming show him the hilt.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hurt him; just show
him the sword and shake your head.&nbsp; He will
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman&rsquo;s expression, when subsequently Faust
presented him to Marguerite, would have been interesting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me, my wife.&nbsp; My dear, a&mdash;a friend of
mine.&nbsp; You may remember meeting him that night at your
aunt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have said, there would have been ructions; but I do not
myself see what could have been done.&nbsp; There was nothing in
the bond to the effect that Faust should not marry, so far as we
are told.&nbsp; The Old Man had a sense of humour.&nbsp; My own
opinion is that, after getting over the first annoyance, he
himself would have seen the joke.&nbsp; I can even picture him
looking in now and again on Mr. and Mrs. Faust.&nbsp; The
children would be hurried off to bed.&nbsp; There would be, for a
while, an atmosphere of constraint.</p>
<p>But the Old Man had a way with him.&nbsp; He would have told
one or two stories at which Marguerite would have blushed, at
which Faust would have grinned.&nbsp; I can see the old fellow
occasionally joining the homely social board.&nbsp; The children,
awed at first, would have sat silent, with staring eyes.&nbsp;
But, as I have said, the Old Man had a way with him.&nbsp; Why
should he not have reformed?&nbsp; The good woman&rsquo;s
unconsciously exerted influence&mdash;the sweet childish
prattle!&nbsp; One hears of such things.&nbsp; Might he not have
come to be known as &ldquo;Nunkie&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Myself&mdash;I believe I have already mentioned it&mdash;I
would not have married Marguerite.&nbsp; She is not my ideal of a
good girl.&nbsp; I never liked the way she deceived her
mother.&nbsp; And that aunt of hers!&nbsp; Well, a nice girl
would not have been friends with such a woman.&nbsp; She did not
behave at all too well to Sybil, either.&nbsp; It is clear to me
that she led the boy on.&nbsp; And what was she doing with that
box of jewels, anyhow?&nbsp; She was not a fool.&nbsp; She could
not have gone every day to that fountain, chatted with those girl
friends of hers, and learnt nothing.&nbsp; She must have known
that people don&rsquo;t go leaving twenty thousand pounds&rsquo;
worth of jewels about on doorsteps as part of a round game.&nbsp;
Her own instinct, if she had been a good girl, would have told
her to leave the thing alone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in these innocent people who do not know
what they are doing half their time.&nbsp; Ask any London
magistrate what he thinks of the lady who explains that she
picked up the diamond brooch:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not meaning, of course, your Worship, to take it.&nbsp;
I would not do such a thing.&nbsp; It just happened this way,
your Worship.&nbsp; I was standing as you might say here, and not
seeing anyone about in the shop I opened the case and took it
out, thinking as perhaps it might belong to someone; and then
this gentleman here, as I had not noticed before, comes up quite
suddenly and says; &lsquo;You come along with me,&rsquo; he
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;What for,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;when I
don&rsquo;t even know you?&rsquo; I says.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
stealing,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a hard
word to use to a lady,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what you mean, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if she had put them all on, not thinking, what would a
really nice girl have done when the gentleman came up and assured
her they were hers?&nbsp; She would have been thirty seconds
taking them off and flinging them back into the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she would have said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you to leave this garden as quickly as
you entered it and take them with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not that
sort of girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marguerite clings to the jewels, and accepts the young
man&rsquo;s arm for a moonlight promenade.&nbsp; And when it does
enter into her innocent head that he and she have walked that
shady garden long enough, what does she do when she has said
good-bye and shut the door?&nbsp; She opens the ground-floor
window and begins to sing!</p>
<p>Maybe I am not poetical, but I do like justice.&nbsp; When
other girls do these sort of things they get called names.&nbsp;
I cannot see why this particular girl should be held up as an
ideal.&nbsp; She kills her mother.&nbsp; According to her own
account this was an accident.&nbsp; It is not an original line of
defence, and we are not allowed to hear the evidence for the
prosecution.&nbsp; She also kills her baby.&nbsp; You are not to
blame her for that, because at the time she was feeling
poorly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why this girl should have a
special line of angels to take her up to heaven.&nbsp; There must
have been decent, hard-working women in N&uuml;rnburg more
entitled to the ticket.</p>
<p>Why is it that all these years we have been content to accept
Marguerite as a type of innocence and virtue?&nbsp; The
explanation is, I suppose, that Goethe wrote at a time when it
was the convention to regard all women as good.&nbsp; Anything in
petticoats was virtuous.&nbsp; If she did wrong it was always
somebody else&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; <i>Cherchez la femme</i> was a
later notion.&nbsp; In the days of Goethe it was always
<i>Cherchez l&rsquo;homme</i>.&nbsp; It was the man&rsquo;s
fault.&nbsp; It was the devil&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; It was
anybody&rsquo;s fault you liked, but not her&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The convention has not yet died out.&nbsp; I was reading the
other day a most interesting book by a brilliant American
authoress.&nbsp; Seeing I live far away from the lady&rsquo;s
haunts, I venture to mention names.&nbsp; I am speaking of
&ldquo;Patience Sparhawk,&rdquo; by Gertrude Atherton.&nbsp; I
take this book because it is typical of a large body of
fiction.&nbsp; Miss Sparhawk lives a troubled life: it puzzles
her.&nbsp; She asks herself what is wrong.&nbsp; Her own idea is
that it is civilisation.</p>
<p>If it is not civilisation, then it is the American man or
Nature&mdash;or Democracy.&nbsp; Miss Sparhawk marries the wrong
man.&nbsp; Later on she gets engaged to another wrong man.&nbsp;
In the end we are left to believe she is about to be married to
the right man.&nbsp; I should be better satisfied if I could hear
Miss Sparhawk talking six months after that last marriage.&nbsp;
But if a mistake has again been made I am confident that, in Miss
Sparhawk&rsquo;s opinion, the fault will not be Miss
Sparhawk&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The argument is always the same: Miss
Sparhawk, being a lady, can do no wrong.</p>
<p>If Miss Sparhawk cared to listen to me for five minutes, I
feel I could put her right on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true, my dear girl,&rdquo; I should say to
her, &ldquo;something is wrong&mdash;very wrong.&nbsp; But it is
not the American man.&nbsp; Never you mind the American man: you
leave him to worry out his own salvation.&nbsp; You are not the
girl to put him right, even where he is wrong.&nbsp; And it is
not civilisation.&nbsp; Civilisation has a deal to answer for, I
admit: don&rsquo;t you load it up with this additional
trouble.&nbsp; The thing that is wrong in this case of
yours&mdash;if you will forgive my saying so&mdash;is you.&nbsp;
You make a fool of yourself; you marry a man who is a mere animal
because he appeals to your animal instincts.&nbsp; Then, like the
lady who cried out &lsquo;Alack, I&rsquo;ve married a
black,&rsquo; you appeal to heaven against the injustice of being
mated with a clown.&nbsp; You are not a nice girl, either in your
ideas or in your behaviour.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blame you for it;
you did not make yourself.&nbsp; But when you set to work to
attract all that is lowest in man, why be so astonished at your
own success?&nbsp; There are plenty of shocking American men, I
agree.&nbsp; One meets the class even outside America.&nbsp; But
nice American girls will tell you that there are also nice
American men.&nbsp; There is an old proverb about birds of a
feather.&nbsp; Next time you find yourself in the company of a
shocking American man, you just ask yourself how he got there,
and how it is he seems to be feeling at home.&nbsp; You learn
self-control.&nbsp; Get it out of your head that you are the
centre of the universe, and grasp the idea that a petticoat is
not a halo, and you will find civilisation not half as wrong as
you thought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know what Miss Sparhawk&rsquo;s reply would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say all this to me&mdash;to me, a lady?&nbsp; Great
Heavens!&nbsp; What has become of chivalry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Frenchman was once put on trial for murdering his father and
mother.&nbsp; He confessed his guilt, but begged for mercy on the
plea that he was an orphan.&nbsp; Chivalry was founded on the
assumption that woman was worthy to be worshipped.&nbsp; The
modern woman&rsquo;s notion is that when she does wrong she ought
to be excused by chivalrous man because she is a lady.</p>
<p>I like the naughty heroine; we all of us do.&nbsp; The early
Victorian heroine&mdash;the angel in a white frock, was a
bore.&nbsp; We knew exactly what she was going to do&mdash;the
right thing.&nbsp; We did not even have to ask ourselves,
&ldquo;What will she think is the right thing to do under the
circumstances?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was always the conventional right
thing.&nbsp; You could have put it to a Sunday school and have
got the answer every time.&nbsp; The heroine with passions,
instincts, emotions, is to be welcomed.&nbsp; But I want her to
grasp the fact that after all she is only one of us.&nbsp; I
should like her better if, instead of demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is wrong in civilisation?&nbsp; What is the world
coming to?&rdquo; and so forth, she would occasionally say to
herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve made a fool of myself this time.&nbsp;
I do feel that &rsquo;shamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would not lose by it.&nbsp; We should respect her all the
more.</p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>WHAT
MRS. WILKINS THOUGHT ABOUT IT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> year, travelling on the
Underground Railway, I met a man; he was one of the
saddest-looking men I had seen for years.&nbsp; I used to know
him well in the old days when we were journalists together.&nbsp;
I asked him, in a sympathetic tone, how things were going with
him.&nbsp; I expected his response would be a flood of tears, and
that in the end I should have to fork out a fiver.&nbsp; To my
astonishment, his answer was that things were going exceedingly
well with him.&nbsp; I did not want to say to him bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what has happened to you to make you look like a
mute at a temperance funeral?&rdquo; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are all at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that if the trouble lay there he would take the
opportunity.&nbsp; It brightened him somewhat, the necessity of
replying to the question.&nbsp; It appeared that his wife was in
the best of health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember her,&rdquo; he continued with a smile;
&ldquo;wonderful spirits, always cheerful, nothing seems to put
her out, not even&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ended the sentence abruptly with a sigh.</p>
<p>His mother-in-law, I learned from further talk with him, had
died since I had last met him, and had left them a comfortable
addition to their income.&nbsp; His eldest daughter was engaged
to be married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is entirely a love match,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and he is such a dear, good fellow, that I should not have
made any objection even had he been poor.&nbsp; But, of course,
as it is, I am naturally all the more content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eldest boy, having won the Mottle Scholarship, was going
up to Cambridge in the Autumn.&nbsp; His own health, he told me,
had greatly improved; and a novel he had written in his leisure
time promised to be one of the successes of the season.&nbsp;
Then it was that I spoke plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am opening a wound too painful to be
touched,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me.&nbsp; If, on the
contrary, it is an ordinary sort of trouble upon which the
sympathy of a fellow worker may fall as balm, let me hear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I
should be glad to tell you.&nbsp; Speaking about it does me good,
and may lead&mdash;so I am always in hopes&mdash;to an
idea.&nbsp; But, for your own sake, if you take my advice, you
will not press me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it affect me?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;it is
nothing to do with me, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It need have nothing to do with you,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;if you are sensible enough to keep out of
it.&nbsp; If I tell you: from this time onward it will be your
trouble also.&nbsp; Anyhow, that is what has happened in four
other separate cases.&nbsp; If you like to be the fifth and
complete the half dozen of us, you are welcome.&nbsp; But
remember I have warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has it done to the other five?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has changed them from cheerful, companionable
persons into gloomy one-idead bores,&rdquo; he told me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They think of but one thing, they talk of but one thing,
they dream of but one thing.&nbsp; Instead of getting over it, as
time goes on, it takes possession of them more and more.&nbsp;
There are men, of course, who would be unaffected by it&mdash;who
could shake it off.&nbsp; I warn you in particular against it,
because, in spite of all that is said, I am convinced you have a
sense of humour; and that being so, it will lay hold of
you.&nbsp; It will plague you night and day.&nbsp; You see what
it has made of me!&nbsp; Three months ago a lady interviewer
described me as of a sunny temperament.&nbsp; If you know your
own business you will get out at the next station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish now I had followed his advice.&nbsp; As it was, I
allowed my curiosity to take possession of me, and begged him to
explain.&nbsp; And he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just about Christmas time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We were discussing the Drury Lane Pantomime&mdash;some
three or four of us&mdash;in the smoking room of the Devonshire
Club, and young Gold said he thought it would prove a mistake,
the introduction of a subject like the Fiscal question into the
story of Humpty Dumpty.&nbsp; The two things, so far as he could
see, had nothing to do with one another.&nbsp; He added that he
entertained a real regard for Mr. Dan Leno, whom he had once met
on a steamboat, but that there were other topics upon which he
would prefer to seek that gentleman&rsquo;s guidance.&nbsp;
Nettleship, on the other hand, declared that he had no sympathy
with the argument that artists should never intrude upon public
affairs.&nbsp; The actor was a fellow citizen with the rest of
us.&nbsp; He said that, whether one agreed with their conclusions
or not, one must admit that the nation owed a debt of gratitude
to Mrs. Brown Potter and to Miss Olga Nethersole for giving to it
the benefit of their convictions.&nbsp; He had talked to both
ladies in private on the subject and was convinced they knew as
much about it as did most people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burnside, who was one of the party, contended that if
sides were to be taken, a pantomime should surely advocate the
Free-Food Cause, seeing it was a form of entertainment supposed
to appeal primarily to the tastes of the Little Englander.&nbsp;
Then I came into the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Fiscal question,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is on
everybody&rsquo;s tongue.&nbsp; Such being the case, it is fit
and proper it should be referred to in our annual pantomime,
which has come to be regarded as a review of the year&rsquo;s
doings.&nbsp; But it should not have been dealt with from the
political standpoint.&nbsp; The proper attitude to have assumed
towards it was that of innocent raillery, free from all trace of
partisanship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Johnson had strolled up and was standing behind
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The very thing I have been trying to get hold of
for weeks,&rsquo; he said&mdash;&lsquo;a bright, amusing
<i>resum&eacute;</i> of the whole problem that should give
offence to neither side.&nbsp; You know our paper,&rsquo; he
continued; &lsquo;we steer clear of politics, but, at the same
time, try to be up-to-date; it is not always easy.&nbsp; The
treatment of the subject, on the lines you suggest, is just what
we require.&nbsp; I do wish you would write me
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good old sort, Johnson; it seemed an easy
thing.&nbsp; I said I would.&nbsp; Since that time I have been
thinking how to do it.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I have not
thought of much else.&nbsp; Maybe you can suggest
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was feeling in a good working mood the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilson,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;shall have the
benefit of this.&nbsp; He does not need anything boisterously
funny.&nbsp; A few playfully witty remarks on the subject will be
the ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lit a pipe and sat down to think.&nbsp; At half-past twelve,
having to write some letters before going out to lunch, I
dismissed the Fiscal question from my mind.</p>
<p>But not for long.&nbsp; It worried me all the afternoon.&nbsp;
I thought, maybe, something would come to me in the
evening.&nbsp; I wasted all that evening, and I wasted all the
following morning.&nbsp; Everything has its amusing side, I told
myself.&nbsp; One turns out comic stories about funerals, about
weddings.&nbsp; Hardly a misfortune that can happen to mankind
but has produced its comic literature.&nbsp; An American friend
of mine once took a contract from the Editor of an Insurance
Journal to write four humorous stories; one was to deal with an
earthquake, the second with a cyclone, the third with a flood,
and the fourth with a thunderstorm.&nbsp; And more amusing
stories I have never read.&nbsp; What is the matter with the
Fiscal question?</p>
<p>I myself have written lightly on Bime-metallism.&nbsp; Home
Rule we used to be merry over in the eighties.&nbsp; I remember
one delightful evening at the Codgers&rsquo; Hall.&nbsp; It would
have been more delightful still, but for a raw-boned Irishman,
who rose towards eleven o&rsquo;clock and requested to be
informed if any other speaker was wishful to make any more jokes
on the subject of Ould Ireland; because, if so, the raw-boned
gentleman was prepared to save time by waiting and dealing with
them altogether.&nbsp; But if not, then&mdash;so the raw-boned
gentleman announced&mdash;his intention was to go for the last
speaker and the last speaker but two at once and without further
warning.</p>
<p>No other humourist rising, the raw-boned gentleman proceeded
to make good his threat, with the result that the fun degenerated
somewhat.&nbsp; Even on the Boer War we used to whisper jokes to
one another in quiet places.&nbsp; In this Fiscal question there
must be fun.&nbsp; Where is it?</p>
<p>For days I thought of little else.&nbsp; My laundress&mdash;as
we call them in the Temple&mdash;noticed my trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;I am trying to
think of something innocently amusing to say on the Fiscal
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard about it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave much time to read the
papers.&nbsp; They want to make us pay more for our food,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some of it,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
then, we shall pay less for other things, so that really we
shan&rsquo;t be paying more at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There don&rsquo;t seem much in it, either way,&rdquo;
was Mrs. Wilkins&rsquo; opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;that is the advantage
of the system.&nbsp; It will cost nobody anything, and will
result in everybody being better off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pity is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins &ldquo;that pity
nobody ever thought of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole trouble hitherto,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;has been the foreigner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;I never
&rsquo;eard much good of &rsquo;em, though they do say the
Almighty &rsquo;as a use for almost everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These foreigners,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;these
Germans and Americans, they dump things on us, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s dump?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s dumping, you
know.&nbsp; You take things, and you dump them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what things?&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow do they do it?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all sorts of things: pig iron, bacon,
door-mats&mdash;everything.&nbsp; They bring them over
here&mdash;in ships, you understand&mdash;and then, if you
please, just dump them down upon our shores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean surely to tell me that they just
throw them out and leave them there?&rdquo; queried Mrs.
Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;when I say they
dump these things upon our shores, that is a figure of
speech.&nbsp; What I mean is they sell them to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do we buy them if we don&rsquo;t want
them?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Wilkins; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not bound to
buy them, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is their artfulness,&rdquo; I explained,
&ldquo;these Germans and Americans, and the others; they are all
just as bad as one another&mdash;they insist on selling us these
things at less price than they cost to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a bit silly of them, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
thought Mrs. Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose being foreigners,
poor things, they ain&rsquo;t naturally got much
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem silly of them, if you look at it that
way,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but what we have got to consider
is, the injury it is doing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;ow it can do us much
&rsquo;arm,&rdquo; argued Mrs. Wilkins; &ldquo;seems a bit of
luck so far as we are concerned.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a few more
things they&rsquo;d be welcome to dump round my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to be putting this thing quite in
the right light to you, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I confessed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a long argument, and you might not be able to follow
it; but you must take it as a fact now generally admitted that
the cheaper you buy things the sooner your money goes.&nbsp; By
allowing the foreigner to sell us all these things at about half
the cost price, he is getting richer every day, and we are
getting poorer.&nbsp; Unless we, as a country, insist on paying
at least twenty per cent. more for everything we want, it is
calculated that in a very few years England won&rsquo;t have a
penny left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds a bit topsy turvy,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may sound so,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I fear
there can be no doubt of it.&nbsp; The Board of Trade Returns
would seem to prove it conclusively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God be praised, we&rsquo;ve found it out in
time,&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Wilkins piously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of congratulation,&rdquo; I agreed;
&ldquo;the difficulty is that a good many other people say that
far from being ruined, we are doing very well indeed, and are
growing richer every year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;ow can they say that,&rdquo; argued Mrs.
Wilkins, &ldquo;when, as you tell me, those Trade Returns prove
just the opposite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they say the same, Mrs. Wilkins, that the Board
of Trade Returns prove just the opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they can&rsquo;t both be right,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be surprised, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;how many things can be proved from Board of Trade
Returns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I have not yet thought of that article for Pilson.</p>
<h2><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>SHALL WE BE RUINED BY CHINESE CHEAP LABOUR?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What</span> is all this talk I
&rsquo;ear about the Chinese?&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins to me the
other morning.&nbsp; We generally indulge in a little chat while
Mrs. Wilkins is laying the breakfast-table.&nbsp; Letters and
newspapers do not arrive in my part of the Temple much before
nine.&nbsp; From half-past eight to nine I am rather glad of Mrs.
Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;They &rsquo;ave been up to some of their
tricks again, &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foreigner, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;whether he be Chinee or any other he, is always up to
tricks.&nbsp; Was not England specially prepared by an all-wise
Providence to frustrate these knavish tricks?&nbsp; Which of such
particular tricks may you be referring to at the moment, Mrs.
Wilkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; over
&rsquo;ere&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he, sir? to take the work out of our
mouths, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly over here, to England, Mrs.
Wilkins,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has been introduced
into Africa to work in the mines there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,
&ldquo;but to &rsquo;ear the way some of them talk in our block,
you might run away with the notion&mdash;that is, if you
didn&rsquo;t know &rsquo;em&mdash;that work was their only
joy.&nbsp; I said to one of &rsquo;em, the other evening&mdash;a
man as calls &rsquo;isself a brass finisher, though, Lord knows,
the only brass &rsquo;e ever finishes is what &rsquo;is poor wife
earns and isn&rsquo;t quick enough to &rsquo;ide away from
&rsquo;im&mdash;well, whatever &rsquo;appens, I says, it will be
clever of &rsquo;em if they take away much work from you.&nbsp;
It made them all laugh, that did,&rdquo; added Mrs. Wilkins, with
a touch of pardonable pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; continued the good lady, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
surprising &rsquo;ow contented they can be with a little, some of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Give &rsquo;em a &rsquo;ard-working woman to
look after them, and a day out once a week with a procession of
the unemployed, they don&rsquo;t ask for nothing more.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s that beauty my poor sister Jane was fool enough to
marry.&nbsp; Serves &rsquo;er right, as I used to tell &rsquo;er
at first, till there didn&rsquo;t seem any more need to rub it
into &rsquo;er.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad one good
&rsquo;usband.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave been fair for
&rsquo;er to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad another, even if there&rsquo;d
been a chance of it, seeing the few of &rsquo;em there is to go
round among so many.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s always the same with us
widows: if we &rsquo;appen to &rsquo;ave been lucky the first
time, we put it down to our own judgment&mdash;think we
can&rsquo;t ever make a mistake; and if we draw a wrong
&rsquo;un, as the saying is, we argue as if it was the duty of
Providence to make it up to us the second time.&nbsp; Why,
I&rsquo;d a been making a fool of myself three years ago if
&rsquo;e &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been good-natured enough to call one
afternoon when I was out, and &rsquo;ook it off with two pounds
eight in the best teapot that I &rsquo;ad been soft enough to
talk to &rsquo;im about: and never let me set eyes on &rsquo;im
again.&nbsp; God bless &rsquo;im!&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s one of
the born-tireds, &rsquo;e is, as poor Jane might &rsquo;ave seen
for &rsquo;erself, if she &rsquo;ad only looked at &rsquo;im,
instead of listening to &rsquo;im.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s courtship all the world over&mdash;old
and young alike, so far as I&rsquo;ve been able to see it,&rdquo;
was the opinion of Mrs. Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s all
eyes and the woman all ears.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t seem to
&rsquo;ave any other senses left &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I ran against
&rsquo;im the other night, on my way &rsquo;ome, at the corner of
Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road.&nbsp; There was the usual crowd watching a
pack of them Italians laying down the asphalt in &rsquo;Olborn,
and &rsquo;e was among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; &rsquo;E &rsquo;ad
secured the only lamp-post, and was leaning agen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;glad to see you
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t lost your job.&nbsp; Nothin&rsquo; like
stickin&rsquo; to it, when you&rsquo;ve dropped into
somethin&rsquo; that really suits you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean, Martha?&rsquo; &rsquo;e
says.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s not one of what I call your smart
sort.&nbsp; It takes a bit of sarcasm to get through &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re still
on the old track, I see, looking for work.&nbsp; Take care you
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave an accident one of these days and run up
agen it before you&rsquo;ve got time to get out of its
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s these miserable foreigners,&rsquo;
&rsquo;e says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at &rsquo;em,&rsquo; &rsquo;e
says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s enough of you doing that,&rsquo; I
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got my room to put straight and
three hours needlework to do before I can get to bed.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t let me &rsquo;inder you.&nbsp; You might forget what
work was like, if you didn&rsquo;t take an opportunity of
watching it now and then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They come over &rsquo;ere,&rsquo; &rsquo;e says,
&lsquo;and take the work away from us chaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;poor things, perhaps
they ain&rsquo;t married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lazy devils! &rsquo;e says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at
&rsquo;em, smoking cigarettes.&nbsp; I could do that sort of
work.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing in it.&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t
take &rsquo;eathen foreigners to dab a bit of tar about a
road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you always could do
anybody else&rsquo;s work but your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t find it, Martha,&rsquo; &rsquo;e
says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and you never will in
the sort of places you go looking for it.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ang it out on lamp-posts, and they don&rsquo;t leave it
about at the street corners.&nbsp; Go &rsquo;ome,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;and turn the mangle for your poor wife.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
big enough for you to find, even in the dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for work!&rdquo; snorted Mrs. Wilkins with
contempt; &ldquo;we women never &rsquo;ave much difficulty in
finding it, I&rsquo;ve noticed.&nbsp; There are times when I feel
I could do with losing it for a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did he reply, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I asked;
&ldquo;your brass-finishing friend, who was holding forth on the
subject of Chinese cheap labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Wilkins as a
conversationalist is not easily kept to the point.&nbsp; I was
curious to know what the working classes were thinking on the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;&rsquo;e
did not say nothing.&nbsp; &rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t the sort
that&rsquo;s got much to say in an argument.&nbsp; &rsquo;E
belongs to the crowd that &rsquo;angs about at the back, and does
the shouting.&nbsp; But there was another of &rsquo;em, a young
fellow as I feels sorry for, with a wife and three small
children, who &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad much luck for the last
six months; and that through no fault of &rsquo;is own, I should
say, from the look of &rsquo;im.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was a
fool,&rsquo; says &rsquo;e, &lsquo;when I chucked a good
situation and went out to the war.&nbsp; They told me I was going
to fight for equal rights for all white men.&nbsp; I thought they
meant that all of us were going to &rsquo;ave a better chance,
and it seemed worth making a bit of sacrifice for, that
did.&nbsp; I should be glad if they would give me a job in their
mines that would enable me to feed my wife and children.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all I ask them for!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a difficult problem, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;According to the mine owners&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t seem to be exactly what you&rsquo;d call popular,
them mine owners, do they?&nbsp; Daresay they&rsquo;re not as bad
as they&rsquo;re painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;paint
them very black.&nbsp; There are those who hold that the South
African mine-owner is not a man at all, but a kind of pantomime
demon.&nbsp; You take Goliath, the whale that swallowed Jonah, a
selection from the least respectable citizens of Sodom and
Gomorrah at their worst, Bluebeard, Bloody Queen Mary, Guy
Fawkes, and the sea-serpent&mdash;or, rather, you take the most
objectionable attributes of all these various personages, and mix
them up together.&nbsp; The result is the South African
mine-owner, a monster who would willingly promote a company for
the putting on the market of a new meat extract, prepared
exclusively from new-born infants, provided the scheme promised a
fair and reasonable opportunity of fleecing the widow and
orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard they&rsquo;re a bad lot,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re most of us that,
if we listen to what other people say about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One never arrives at the truth by listening to one side
only.&nbsp; On the other hand, for example, there are those who
stoutly maintain that the South African mine-owner is a kind of
spiritual creature, all heart and sentiment, who, against his own
will, has been, so to speak, dumped down upon this earth as the
result of over-production up above of the higher class of
archangel.&nbsp; The stock of archangels of superior finish
exceeds the heavenly demand; the surplus has been dropped down
into South Africa and has taken to mine owning.&nbsp; It is not
that these celestial visitors of German sounding nomenclature
care themselves about the gold.&nbsp; Their only desire is,
during this earthly pilgrimage of theirs, to benefit the human
race.&nbsp; Nothing can be obtained in this world without
money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gold, everything can be obtained.&nbsp; The aim of
the mine-owning archangel is to provide the world with
gold.&nbsp; Why should the world trouble to grow things and make
things?&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us,&rsquo; say these archangels,
temporarily dwelling in South Africa, &lsquo;dig up and
distribute to the world plenty of gold, then the world can buy
whatever it wants, and be happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a flaw in the argument, Mrs.
Wilkins,&rdquo; I allowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not presenting it to
you as the last word upon the subject.&nbsp; I am merely quoting
the view of the South African mine-owner, feeling himself a much
misunderstood benefactor of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;they are
just the ordinary sort of Christian, like the rest of us, anxious
to do the best they can for themselves, and not too particular as
to doing other people in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to think, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;that you are not very far from the truth.&nbsp; A friend
of mine, a year ago, was very bitter on this subject of Chinese
cheap labour.&nbsp; A little later there died a distant relative
of his who left him twenty thousand South African mining
shares.&nbsp; He thinks now that to object to the Chinese is
narrow-minded, illiberal, and against all religious
teaching.&nbsp; He has bought an abridged edition of Confucius,
and tells me that there is much that is ennobling in Chinese
morality.&nbsp; Indeed, I gather from him that the introduction
of the Chinese into South Africa will be the saving of that
country.&nbsp; The noble Chinese will afford an object lesson to
the poor white man, displaying to him the virtues of sobriety,
thrift, and humility.&nbsp; I also gather that it will be of
inestimable benefit to the noble Chinee himself.&nbsp; The
Christian missionary will get hold of him in bulk, so to speak,
and imbue him with the higher theology.&nbsp; It appears to be
one of those rare cases where everybody is benefited at the
expense of nobody.&nbsp; It is always a pity to let these rare
opportunities slip by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
nothin&rsquo; to say agen the Chinaman, as a Chinaman.&nbsp; As
to &rsquo;is being a &rsquo;eathen, well, throwin&rsquo; stones
at a church, as the sayin&rsquo; is, don&rsquo;t make a Christian
of you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Christians I&rsquo;ve met as
couldn&rsquo;t do themselves much &rsquo;arm by changing their
religion; and as to cleanliness, well, I&rsquo;ve never met but
one, and &rsquo;e was a washerwoman, and I&rsquo;d rather
&rsquo;ave sat next to &rsquo;im in a third-class carriage on a
Bank &rsquo;Oliday than next to some of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Wilkins,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got into the &rsquo;abit of talkin&rsquo; a
bit too much about other people&rsquo;s dirt.&nbsp; The London
atmosphere ain&rsquo;t nat&rsquo;rally a dry-cleanin&rsquo;
process in itself, but there&rsquo;s a goodish few as seem to
think it is.&nbsp; One comes across Freeborn Britons &rsquo;ere
and there as I&rsquo;d be sorry to scrub clean for a
shillin&rsquo; and find my own soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a universal failing, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you talk to a travelled Frenchman, he
contrasts to his own satisfaction the Paris <i>ouvrier</i> in his
blue blouse with the appearance of the London
labourer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay they&rsquo;re all right according to their
lights,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;but it does seem a bit
wrong that if our own chaps are willin&rsquo; and anxious to
work, after all they&rsquo;ve done, too, in the way of getting
the mines for us, they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed the
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, Mrs. Wilkins, it is difficult to arrive at a
just conclusion,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mine-owner,
according to his enemies, hates the British workman with the
natural instinct that evil creatures feel towards the noble and
virtuous.&nbsp; He will go to trouble and expense merely to spite
the British workman, to keep him out of South Africa.&nbsp;
According to his friends, the mine-owner sets his face against
the idea of white labour for two reasons.&nbsp; First and
foremost, it is not nice work; the mine-owner hates the thought
of his beloved white brother toiling in the mines.&nbsp; It is
not right that the noble white man should demean himself by such
work.&nbsp; Secondly, white labour is too expensive.&nbsp; If for
digging gold men had to be paid anything like the same prices
they are paid for digging coal, the mines could not be
worked.&nbsp; The world would lose the gold that the mine-owner
is anxious to bestow upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine-owner, following his own inclinations, would
take a little farm, grow potatoes, and live a beautiful
life&mdash;perhaps write a little poetry.&nbsp; A slave to sense
of duty, he is chained to the philanthropic work of
gold-mining.&nbsp; If we hamper him and worry him the danger is
that he will get angry with us&mdash;possibly he will order his
fiery chariot and return to where he came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;e can&rsquo;t take the gold with him,
wherever &rsquo;e goes to?&rdquo; argued Mrs. Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as if the
gold were of more value to the world than is the
mine-owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Wilkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new idea, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;it wants thinking out.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>HOW
TO SOLVE THE SERVANT PROBLEM.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">am</span> glad to see, Mrs.
Wilkins,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the Women&rsquo;s Domestic
Guild of America has succeeded in solving the servant girl
problem&mdash;none too soon, one might almost say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, as she took the cover off
the bacon and gave an extra polish to the mustard-pot with her
apron, &ldquo;they are clever people over there; leastways, so
I&rsquo;ve always &rsquo;eard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, their latest, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I am inclined to regard as their greatest triumph.&nbsp;
My hope is that the Women&rsquo;s Domestic Guild of America, when
it has finished with the United States and Canada, will, perhaps,
see its way to establishing a branch in England.&nbsp; There are
ladies of my acquaintance who would welcome, I feel sure, any
really satisfactory solution of the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck to it, is all I say,&rdquo; responded
Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;and if it makes all the gals contented with
their places, and all the mistresses satisfied with what
they&rsquo;ve got and &rsquo;appy in their minds, why, God bless
it, say I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake hitherto,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;from what I
read, appears to have been that the right servant was not sent to
the right place.&nbsp; What the Women&rsquo;s Domestic Guild of
America proposes to do is to find the right servant for the right
place.&nbsp; You see the difference, don&rsquo;t you, Mrs.
Wilkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the secret,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Wilkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t anticipate any difficulty
in getting the right sort of gal, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gather not, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins is of a pessimistic turn of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure about it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the
Almighty don&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave made too many of that
sort.&nbsp; Unless these American ladies that you speak of are
going to start a factory of their own.&nbsp; I am afraid there is
disappointment in store for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw cold water on the idea before it is
fairly started, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;I
&rsquo;ave been a gal myself in service; and in my time
I&lsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a few mistresses of my own, and I&rsquo;ve
&rsquo;eard a good deal about others.&nbsp; There are ladies and
ladies, as you may know, sir, and some of them, if they
aren&rsquo;t exactly angels, are about as near to it as can be
looked for in this climate, and they are not the ones that do
most of the complaining.&nbsp; But, as for the average
mistress&mdash;well it ain&rsquo;t a gal she wants, it&rsquo;s a
plaster image, without any natural innards&mdash;a sort of thing
as ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;uman, and ain&rsquo;t to be found in
&rsquo;uman nature.&nbsp; And then she&rsquo;d grumble at it, if
it didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;appen to be able to be in two places at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fear that the standard for that &lsquo;right
girl&rsquo; is likely to be set a trifle too high Mrs.
Wilkins,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;right gal,&rsquo; according to the notions
of some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Wilkins,
&ldquo;&rsquo;er place ain&rsquo;t down &rsquo;ere among us mere
mortals; &rsquo;er place is up in &rsquo;eaven with a &rsquo;arp
and a golden crown.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my niece, Emma, I
don&rsquo;t say she is a saint, but a better &rsquo;earted,
&rsquo;arder working gal, at twenty pounds a year, you
don&rsquo;t expect to find, unless maybe you&rsquo;re a natural
born fool that can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp yourself.&nbsp; She wanted
a place.&nbsp; She &rsquo;ad been &rsquo;ome for nearly six
months, nursing &rsquo;er old father, as &rsquo;ad been down all
the winter with rheumatic fever; and &rsquo;ard-put to it she was
for a few clothes.&nbsp; You &rsquo;ear &rsquo;em talk about gals
as insists on an hour a day for practising the piano, and the
right to invite their young man to spend the evening with them in
the drawing-room.&nbsp; Perhaps it is meant to be funny; I
ain&rsquo;t come across that type of gal myself, outside the
pictures in the comic papers; and I&rsquo;ll never believe, till
I see &rsquo;er myself, that anybody else &rsquo;as.&nbsp; They
sent &rsquo;er from the registry office to a lady at Clapton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I &rsquo;ope you are good at getting up early in
the morning?&rsquo; says the lady, &lsquo;I like a gal as rises
cheerfully to &rsquo;er work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says Emma, &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t say as I&rsquo;ve got a passion for it.&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s one of those things that &rsquo;as to be done, and I
guess I&rsquo;ve learnt the trick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a great believer in early
rising,&rsquo; says my lady; &lsquo;in the morning, one is always
fresher for one&rsquo;s work; my &rsquo;usband and the younger
children breakfast at &rsquo;arf past seven; myself and my eldest
daughter &rsquo;ave our breakfest in bed at eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
says Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I &rsquo;ope,&rsquo; says the lady,
&lsquo;you are of an amiable disposition.&nbsp; Some gals when
you ring the bell come up looking so disagreeable, one almost
wishes one didn&rsquo;t want them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t a thing,&rsquo; explains
Emma, &lsquo;as makes you want to burst out laughing,
&rsquo;earing the bell go off for the twentieth time, and
&rsquo;aving suddenly to put down your work at, perhaps, a
critical moment.&nbsp; Some ladies don&rsquo;t seem able to reach
down their &rsquo;at for themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I &rsquo;ope you are not impertinent,&rsquo;
says the lady; &lsquo;if there&rsquo;s one thing that I object to
in a servant it is impertinence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We none of us like being answered back,&rsquo;
says Emma, &lsquo;more particularly when we are in the
wrong.&nbsp; But I know my place ma&rsquo;am, and I shan&rsquo;t
give you no lip.&nbsp; It always leads to less trouble, I find,
keeping your mouth shut, rather than opening it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you fond of children,&rsquo; asks my
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It depends upon the children,&rsquo; says Emma;
&lsquo;there are some I &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad to do with as made
the day seem pleasanter, and I&rsquo;ve come across others as I
could &rsquo;ave parted from at any moment without
tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I like a gal,&rsquo; says the lady, &lsquo;who
is naturally fond of children, it shows a good
character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many of them are there?&rsquo; says
Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Four of them,&rsquo; answers my lady, &lsquo;but
you won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave much to do except with the two
youngest.&nbsp; The great thing with young children is to
surround them with good examples.&nbsp; Are you a
Christian?&rsquo; asks my lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m generally
called,&rsquo; says Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Every other Sunday evening out is my
rule,&rsquo; says the lady, &lsquo;but of course I shall expect
you to go to church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you mean in my time, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says
Emma, &lsquo;or in yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I mean on your evening of course,&rsquo; says my
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Ow else could you go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says Emma, &lsquo;I
like to see my people now and then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are better things,&rsquo; says my lady,
&lsquo;than seeing what you call your people, and I should not
care to take a girl into my &rsquo;ouse as put &rsquo;er pleasure
before &rsquo;er religion.&nbsp; You are not engaged, I
&rsquo;ope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Walking out, ma&rsquo;am, do you mean?&rsquo;
says Emma.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, there is nobody
I&rsquo;ve got in my mind&mdash;not just at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never will take a gal,&rsquo; explains my
lady, &lsquo;who is engaged.&nbsp; I find it distracts &rsquo;er
attention from &rsquo;er work.&nbsp; And I must insist if you
come to me,&rsquo; continues my lady, &lsquo;that you get
yourself another &rsquo;at and jacket.&nbsp; If there is one
thing I object to in a servant it is a disposition to cheap
finery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Er own daughter was sitting there beside
&rsquo;er with &rsquo;alf a dozen silver bangles on &rsquo;er
wrist, and a sort of thing &rsquo;anging around &rsquo;er neck,
as, &rsquo;ad it been real, would &rsquo;ave been worth perhaps a
thousand pounds.&nbsp; But Emma wanted a job, so she kept
&rsquo;er thoughts to &rsquo;erself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can put these things by and get myself
something else,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind,
ma&rsquo;am, advancing me something out of my first three
months&rsquo; wages.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid my account at the
bank is a bit overdrawn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady whispered something to &rsquo;er
daughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid, on thinking it over,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;that you won&rsquo;t suit, after all.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t look serious enough.&nbsp; I feel sure, from the way
you do your &rsquo;air,&rsquo; says my lady, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
a frivolous side to your nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Emma came away, and was not, on the whole, too
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do they get servants to come to them, this type of
mistress, do you think, Mrs. Wilkins?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get them all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,
&ldquo;and if it&rsquo;s a decent gal, it makes a bad gal of
&rsquo;er, that ever afterwards looks upon every mistress as
&rsquo;er enemy, and acts accordingly.&nbsp; And if she
ain&rsquo;t a naturally good gal, it makes &rsquo;er worse, and
then you &rsquo;ear what awful things gals are.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s an easy problem,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Wilkins, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just like marriages.&nbsp; The good
mistress gets &rsquo;old of the bad servant, and the bad
mistress, as often as not is lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;that in hotels,
for instance, the service is excellent, and the girls, generally
speaking, seem contented?&nbsp; The work is hard, and the wages
not much better, if as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;you &rsquo;ave
&rsquo;it the right nail on the &rsquo;ead, there, sir.&nbsp;
They go into the &rsquo;otels and work like niggers, knowing that
if a single thing goes wrong they will be bully-ragged and sworn
at till they don&rsquo;t know whether they are standing on their
&rsquo;ead or their &rsquo;eels.&nbsp; But they &rsquo;ave their
hours; the gal knows when &rsquo;er work is done, and when the
clock strikes she is a &rsquo;uman being once again.&nbsp; She
&rsquo;as got that moment to look forward to all day, and it
keeps &rsquo;er going.&nbsp; In private service there&rsquo;s no
moment in the day to &rsquo;ope for.&nbsp; If the lady is
reasonable she ain&rsquo;t overworked; but no &rsquo;ow can she
ever feel she is her own mistress, free to come and go, to wear
&rsquo;er bit of finery, to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;er bit of
fun.&nbsp; She works from six in the morning till eleven or
twelve at night, and then she only goes to bed provided she
ain&rsquo;t wanted.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t belong to &rsquo;erself
at all; it&rsquo;s that that irritates them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your point, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and, of course, in a house where two or three servants
were kept some such plan might easily be arranged.&nbsp; The girl
who commenced work at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning might
consider herself free at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp;
What she did with herself, how she dressed herself in her own
time, would be her affair.&nbsp; What church the clerk or the
workman belongs to, what company he keeps, is no concern of the
firm.&nbsp; In such matters, mistresses, I am inclined to think,
saddle themselves with a responsibility for which there is no
need.&nbsp; If the girl behaves herself while in the house, and
does her work, there the contract ends.&nbsp; The mistress who
thinks it her duty to combine the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of employer
and of maiden aunt is naturally resented.&nbsp; The next month
the girl might change her hours from twelve to twelve, and her
fellow-servant could enjoy the six a.m. to six p.m. shift.&nbsp;
But how do you propose to deal, Mrs. Wilkins, with the smaller
<i>menage</i>, that employs only one servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;it seems to
me simple enough.&nbsp; Ladies talk pretty about the dignity of
labour, and are never tired of pointing out why gals should
prefer domestic service to all other kinds of work.&nbsp; Suppose
they practise what they preach.&nbsp; In the &rsquo;ouse, where
there&rsquo;s only the master and the mistress, and, say a couple
of small children, let the lady take her turn.&nbsp; After all,
it&rsquo;s only her duty, same as the office or the shop is the
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Where, on the other &rsquo;and, there are
biggish boys and gals about the place, well it wouldn&rsquo;t do
them any &rsquo;arm to be taught to play a little less, and to
look after themselves a little more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just
arranging things&mdash;that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me of a family I once knew, Mrs.
Wilkins,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it consisted of the usual father
and mother, and of five sad, healthy girls.&nbsp; They kept two
servants&mdash;or, rather, they never kept any servants; they
lived always looking for servants, breaking their hearts over
servants, packing servants off at a moment&rsquo;s notice,
standing disconsolately looking after servants who had packed
themselves off at a moment&rsquo;s notice, wondering generally
what the world was coming too.&nbsp; It occurred to me at the
time, that without much trouble, they could have lived a peaceful
life without servants.&nbsp; The eldest girl was learning
painting&mdash;and seemed unable to learn anything else.&nbsp; It
was poor sort of painting; she noticed it herself.&nbsp; But she
seemed to think that, if she talked a lot about it, and thought
of nothing else, that somehow it would all come right.&nbsp; The
second girl played the violin.&nbsp; She played it from early
morning till late evening, and friends fell away from them.&nbsp;
There wasn&rsquo;t a spark of talent in the family, but they all
had a notion that a vague longing to be admired was just the same
as genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another daughter fancied she would like to be an
actress, and screamed all day in the attic.&nbsp; The fourth
wrote poetry on a typewriter, and wondered why nobody seemed to
want it; while the fifth one suffered from a weird belief that
smearing wood with a red-hot sort of poker was a thing worth
doing for its own sake.&nbsp; All of them seemed willing enough
to work, provided only that it was work of no use to any living
soul.&nbsp; With a little sense, and the occasional assistance of
a charwoman, they could have led a merrier life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was giving away secrets,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilkins,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say to the mistresses: &lsquo;Show yourselves
able to be independent.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because the gals
know that the mistresses can&rsquo;t do without them that they
sometimes gives themselves airs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>WHY
WE HATE THE FOREIGNER.</h2>
<p>The advantage that the foreigner possesses over the Englishman
is that he is born good.&nbsp; He does not have to try to be
good, as we do.&nbsp; He does not have to start the New Year with
the resolution to be good, and succeed, bar accidents, in being
so till the middle of January.&nbsp; He is just good all the year
round.&nbsp; When a foreigner is told to mount or descend from a
tram on the near side, it does not occur to him that it would be
humanly possible to secure egress from or ingress to that tram
from the off side.</p>
<p>In Brussels once I witnessed a daring attempt by a lawless
foreigner to enter a tram from the wrong side.&nbsp; The gate was
open: he was standing close beside it.&nbsp; A line of traffic
was in his way: to have got round to the right side of that tram
would have meant missing it.&nbsp; He entered when the conductor
was not looking, and took his seat.&nbsp; The astonishment of the
conductor on finding him there was immense.&nbsp; How did he get
there?&nbsp; The conductor had been watching the proper entrance,
and the man had not passed him.&nbsp; Later, the true explanation
suggested itself to the conductor, but for a while he hesitated
to accuse a fellow human being of such crime.</p>
<p>He appealed to the passenger himself.&nbsp; Was his presence
to be accounted for by miracle or by sin?&nbsp; The passenger
confessed.&nbsp; It was more in sorrow than in anger that the
conductor requested him at once to leave.&nbsp; This tram was
going to be kept respectable.&nbsp; The passenger proved
refractory, a halt was called, and the gendarmerie appealed
to.&nbsp; After the manner of policemen, they sprang, as it were,
from the ground, and formed up behind an imposing officer, whom I
took to be the sergeant.&nbsp; At first the sergeant could hardly
believe the conductor&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp; Even then, had the
passenger asserted that he had entered by the proper entrance,
his word would have been taken.&nbsp; Much easier to the foreign
official mind would it have been to believe that the conductor
had been stricken with temporary blindness, than that man born of
woman would have deliberately done anything expressly forbidden
by a printed notice.</p>
<p>Myself, in his case, I should have lied and got the trouble
over.&nbsp; But he was a proud man, or had not much
sense&mdash;one of the two, and so held fast to the truth.&nbsp;
It was pointed out to him that he must descend immediately and
wait for the next tram.&nbsp; Other gendarmes were arriving from
every quarter: resistance in the circumstances seemed
hopeless.&nbsp; He said he would get down.&nbsp; He made to
descend this time by the proper gate, but that was not
justice.&nbsp; He had mounted the wrong side, he must alight on
the wrong side.&nbsp; Accordingly, he was put out amongst the
traffic, after which the conductor preached a sermon from the
centre of the tram on the danger of ascents and descents
conducted from the wrong quarter.</p>
<p>There is a law throughout Germany&mdash;an excellent law it
is: I would we had it in England&mdash;that nobody may scatter
paper about the street.&nbsp; An English military friend told me
that, one day in Dresden, unacquainted with this rule, he tore a
long letter he had been reading into some fifty fragments and
threw them behind him.&nbsp; A policeman stopped him and
explained to him quite politely the law upon the subject.&nbsp;
My military friend agreed that it was a very good law, thanked
the man for his information, and said that for the future he
would bear it in mind.&nbsp; That, as the policeman pointed out,
would make things right enough for the future, but meanwhile it
was necessary to deal with the past&mdash;with the fifty or so
pieces of paper lying scattered about the road and pavement.</p>
<p>My military friend, with a pleasant laugh, confessed he did
not see what was to be done.&nbsp; The policeman, more
imaginative, saw a way out.&nbsp; It was that my military friend
should set to work and pick up those fifty scraps of paper.&nbsp;
He is an English General on the Retired List, and of imposing
appearance: his manner on occasion is haughty.&nbsp; He did not
see himself on his hands and knees in the chief street of
Dresden, in the middle of the afternoon, picking up paper.</p>
<p>The German policeman himself admitted that the situation was
awkward.&nbsp; If the English General could not accept it there
happened to be an alternative.&nbsp; It was that the English
General should accompany the policeman through the streets,
followed by the usual crowd, to the nearest prison, some three
miles off.&nbsp; It being now four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, they would probably find the judge departed.&nbsp; But
the most comfortable thing possible in prison cells should be
allotted to him, and the policeman had little doubt that the
General, having paid his fine of forty marks, would find himself
a free man again in time for lunch the following day.&nbsp; The
general suggested hiring a boy to pick up the paper.&nbsp; The
policeman referred to the wording of the law, and found that this
would not be permitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the matter out,&rdquo; my friend told me,
&ldquo;imagining all the possible alternatives, including that of
knocking the fellow down and making a bolt, and came to the
conclusion that his first suggestion would, on the whole, result
in the least discomfort.&nbsp; But I had no idea that picking up
small scraps of thin paper off greasy stones was the business
that I found it!&nbsp; It took me nearly ten minutes, and
afforded amusement, I calculate, to over a thousand people.&nbsp;
But it is a good law, mind you: all I wish is that I had known it
beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion I accompanied an American lady to a German
Opera House.&nbsp; The taking-off of hats in the German
Schausspielhaus is obligatory, and again I would it were so in
England.&nbsp; But the American lady is accustomed to disregard
rules made by mere man.&nbsp; She explained to the doorkeeper
that she was going to wear her hat.&nbsp; He, on his side,
explained to her that she was not: they were both a bit short
with one another.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to turn aside and
buy a programme: the fewer people there are mixed up in an
argument, I always think, the better.</p>
<p>My companion explained quite frankly to the doorkeeper that it
did not matter what he said, she was not going to take any notice
of him.&nbsp; He did not look a talkative man at any time, and,
maybe, this announcement further discouraged him.&nbsp; In any
case, he made no attempt to answer.&nbsp; All he did was to stand
in the centre of the doorway with a far-away look in his
eyes.&nbsp; The doorway was some four feet wide: he was about
three feet six across, and weighed about twenty stone.&nbsp; As I
explained, I was busy buying a programme, and when I returned my
friend had her hat in her hand, and was digging pins into it: I
think she was trying to make believe it was the heart of the
doorkeeper.&nbsp; She did not want to listen to the opera, she
wanted to talk all the time about that doorkeeper, but the people
round us would not even let her do that.</p>
<p>She has spent three winters in Germany since then.&nbsp; Now
when she feels like passing through a door that is standing wide
open just in front of her, and which leads to just the place she
wants to get to, and an official shakes his head at her, and
explains that she must not, but must go up two flights of stairs
and along a corridor and down another flight of stairs, and so
get to her place that way, she apologises for her error and trots
off looking ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>Continental Governments have trained their citizens to
perfection.&nbsp; Obedience is the Continent&rsquo;s first
law.&nbsp; The story that is told of a Spanish king who was
nearly drowned because the particular official whose duty it was
to dive in after Spanish kings when they tumbled out of boats
happened to be dead, and his successor had not yet been
appointed, I can quite believe.&nbsp; On the Continental railways
if you ride second class with a first-class ticket you render
yourself liable to imprisonment.&nbsp; What the penalty is for
riding first with a second-class ticket I cannot
say&mdash;probably death, though a friend of mine came very near
on one occasion to finding out.</p>
<p>All would have gone well with him if he had not been so darned
honest.&nbsp; He is one of those men who pride themselves on
being honest.&nbsp; I believe he takes a positive pleasure in
being honest.&nbsp; He had purchased a second-class ticket for a
station up a mountain, but meeting, by chance on the platform, a
lady acquaintance, had gone with her into a first-class
apartment.&nbsp; On arriving at the journey&rsquo;s end he
explained to the collector what he had done, and, with his purse
in his hand, demanded to know the difference.&nbsp; They took him
into a room and locked the door.&nbsp; They wrote out his
confession and read it over to him, and made him sign it, and
then they sent for a policeman.</p>
<p>The policeman cross-examined him for about a quarter of an
hour.&nbsp; They did not believe the story about the lady.&nbsp;
Where was the lady?&nbsp; He did not know.&nbsp; They searched
the neighbourhood for her, but could not find her.&nbsp; He
suggested&mdash;what turned out to be the truth&mdash;that, tired
of loitering about the station, she had gone up the
mountain.&nbsp; An Anarchist outrage had occurred in the
neighbouring town some months before.&nbsp; The policeman
suggested searching for bombs.&nbsp; Fortunately, a Cook&rsquo;s
agent, returning with a party of tourists, arrived upon the
scene, and took it upon himself to explain in delicate language
that my friend was a bit of an ass and could not tell first class
from second.&nbsp; It was the red cushions that had deceived my
friend: he thought it was first class, as a matter of fact it was
second class.</p>
<p>Everybody breathed again.&nbsp; The confession was torn up
amid universal joy: and then the fool of a ticket collector
wanted to know about the lady&mdash;who must have travelled in a
second-class compartment with a first-class ticket.&nbsp; It
looked as if a bad time were in store for her on her return to
the station.</p>
<p>But the admirable representative of Cook was again equal to
the occasion.&nbsp; He explained that my friend was also a bit of
a liar.&nbsp; When he said he had travelled with this lady he was
merely boasting.&nbsp; He would like to have travelled with her,
that was all he meant, only his German was shaky.&nbsp; Joy once
more entered upon the scene.&nbsp; My friend&rsquo;s character
appeared to be re-established.&nbsp; He was not the abandoned
wretch for whom they had taken him&mdash;only, apparently, a
wandering idiot.&nbsp; Such an one the German official could
respect.&nbsp; At the expense of such an one the German official
even consented to drink beer.</p>
<p>Not only the foreign man, woman and child, but the foreign dog
is born good.&nbsp; In England, if you happen to be the possessor
of a dog, much of your time is taken up dragging him out of
fights, quarrelling with the possessor of the other dog as to
which began it, explaining to irate elderly ladies that he did
not kill the cat, that the cat must have died of heart disease
while running across the road, assuring disbelieving game-keepers
that he is not your dog, that you have not the faintest notion
whose dog he is.&nbsp; With the foreign dog, life is a peaceful
proceeding.&nbsp; When the foreign dog sees a row, tears spring
to his eyes: he hastens on and tries to find a policeman.&nbsp;
When the foreign dog sees a cat in a hurry, he stands aside to
allow her to pass.&nbsp; They dress the foreign dog&mdash;some of
them&mdash;in a little coat, with a pocket for his handkerchief,
and put shoes on his feet.&nbsp; They have not given him a
hat&mdash;not yet.&nbsp; When they do, he will contrive by some
means or another to raise it politely when he meets a cat he
thinks he knows.</p>
<p>One morning, in a Continental city, I came across a
disturbance&mdash;it might be more correct to say the disturbance
came across me: it swept down upon me, enveloped me before I knew
that I was in it.&nbsp; A fox-terrier it was, belonging to a very
young lady&mdash;it was when the disturbance was to a certain
extent over that we discovered he belonged to this young
lady.&nbsp; She arrived towards the end of the disturbance, very
much out of breath: she had been running for a mile, poor girl,
and shouting most of the way.&nbsp; When she looked round and saw
all the things that had happened, and had had other things that
she had missed explained to her, she burst into tears.&nbsp; An
English owner of that fox-terrier would have given one look round
and then have jumped upon the nearest tram going anywhere.&nbsp;
But, as I have said, the foreigner is born good.&nbsp; I left her
giving her name and address to seven different people.</p>
<p>But it was about the dog I wished to speak more
particularly.&nbsp; He had commenced innocently enough, trying to
catch a sparrow.&nbsp; Nothing delights a sparrow more than being
chased by a dog.&nbsp; A dozen times he thought he had the
sparrow.&nbsp; Then another dog had got in his way.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what they call this breed of dog, but abroad it
is popular: it has no tail and looks like a pig&mdash;when things
are going well with it.&nbsp; This particular specimen, when I
saw him, looked more like part of a doormat.&nbsp; The
fox-terrier had seized it by the scruff of the neck and had
rolled it over into the gutter just in front of a motor
cycle.&nbsp; Its owner, a large lady, had darted out to save it,
and had collided with the motor cyclist.&nbsp; The large lady had
been thrown some half a dozen yards against an Italian boy
carrying a tray load of plaster images.</p>
<p>I have seen a good deal of trouble in my life, but never one
yet that did not have an Italian image-vendor somehow or other
mixed up in it.&nbsp; Where these boys hide in times of peace is
a mystery.&nbsp; The chance of being upset brings them out as
sunshine brings out flies.&nbsp; The motor cycle had dashed into
a little milk-cart and had spread it out neatly in the middle of
the tram lines.&nbsp; The tram traffic looked like being stopped
for a quarter of an hour; but the idea of every approaching tram
driver appeared to be that if he rang his bell with sufficient
vigor this seeming obstruction would fade away and disappear.</p>
<p>In an English town all this would not have attracted much
attention.&nbsp; Somebody would have explained that a dog was the
original cause, and the whole series of events would have
appeared ordinary and natural.&nbsp; Upon these foreigners the
fear descended that the Almighty, for some reason, was angry with
them.&nbsp; A policeman ran to catch the dog.</p>
<p>The delighted dog rushed backwards, barking furiously, and
tried to throw up paving stones with its hind legs.&nbsp; That
frightened a nursemaid who was wheeling a perambulator, and then
it was that I entered into the proceedings.&nbsp; Seated on the
edge of the pavement, with a perambulator on one side of me and a
howling baby on the other, I told that dog what I thought of
him.</p>
<p>Forgetful that I was in a foreign land&mdash;that he might not
understand me&mdash;I told it him in English, I told it him at
length, I told it very loud and clear.&nbsp; He stood a yard in
front of me, listening to me with an expression of ecstatic joy I
have never before or since seen equalled on any face, human or
canine.&nbsp; He drank it in as though it had been music from
Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have I heard that song before?&rdquo; he seemed
to be saying to himself, &ldquo;the old familiar language they
used to talk to me when I was young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He approached nearer to me; there were almost tears in his
eyes when I had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it again!&rdquo; he seemed to be asking of
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! say it all over again, the dear old English
oaths and curses that in this God-forsaken land I never hoped to
hear again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I learnt from the young lady that he was an English-born
fox-terrier.&nbsp; That explained everything.&nbsp; The foreign
dog does not do this sort of thing.&nbsp; The foreigner is born
good: that is why we hate him.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
